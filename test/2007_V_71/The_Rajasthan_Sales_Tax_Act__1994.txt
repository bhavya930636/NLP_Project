The Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994
Act No. 22 of 1995
Last Updated 24th May, 2019
Statement of Objects and Reasons - Amendments in the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994 (Act No. 7 of 2002). - A dealer applying for provisional and voluntary registration is required to make payment of fee of Rs. 100/-. With the use of computers and other modern techniques and other cost factors, the registration fee fixed about half a decade age needs upward revision. With this objective sub-section (3) of Section 17 has already been amended in March, 2001. In consonance with the said amendment, sub-section (1) of Section 18 and sub-section (1) of Section 19 providing for the fee for provisional registration and voluntary registration respectively, are required to be amended to empower the State Government to prescribe such fee in accordance with the prevalent circumstances.
Section 71 provides for the prosecution of any person in the contingencies specified in sub-section (1). As per clause (e) of sub-section (1), prosecution for deliberately disregarding the notice issued by the Assessing Authority for recovery of demand, prosecution can be launched. However, similar powers are not available for the non-compliance of the notice issued by the Commissioner u/S. 93 of the Act to call for certain information. Therefore, clause (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 71 is proposed to be amended.
To protect the interest of the consumers, it is being proposed to make it mandatory to issue bill or cash memorandum by every registered dealer on each sales of goods, other than the exempted goods, of value of rupees two hundred or more. Failure to do so will incur penalty of a sum equal to five times of the amount of tax leviable on the sale in question or rupees five hundred, whichever is higher. With these objectives the existing Section 76 is proposed to be suitably amended.
To have a check on the evasion of tax by unscrupulous dealers/transporters by nondisclosure of the details of the goods at the nearest border check-posts established under sub-section (1) of Section 78, the existing clause (b) of the Section 78 is being amended to make it mandatory to bring the vehicle or carrier at the nearest border check-post while entering or leaving the State. Failure to do so has been made subject to penalty by adding a new sub-section (10-A) in Section 78.
While filing first appeal, the appellant is required to deposit the admitted amount of tax or other admitted amount or ten per cent of the tax or the other amount assessed and in case of an appeal from an ex-parte assessment order five per cent of the tax or the other amount assessed, whichever is higher. The section is proposed to be amended suitably to encourage rightful appeals to be filed.
Section 87 provides for power of revision to Commissioner in case an order passed by the subordinate authorities is erroneous as well as prejudicial to the interest of the revenue. Both these conditions have to be satisfied for exercising these powers. Even in case of patently erroneous order passed by such authorities cannot be questioned except at the appellate forum, which may result in substantial delay in getting the grievances redressed. Therefore, by amending sub-section (1) of Section 87 of the Act, it is proposed that the powers of revisions can be exercised on fulfilment of either of the above two conditions.
As per present provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 93 the Commissioner can ask for submission of specific information from dealers but not from other persons. For effective enforcement of the provisions of the Act, it is proposed to include words "any person" in the aforesaid sub-section.
