This Bill seeks to amend Sections 32-M, 32-PP, 32PPP and 32-QQ of the said Act to achieve the aforesaid object.
Memorandum Regarding delegated legislation
The Bill involves delegation of legislative power in following respect:-

The delegation of legislative power, as aforesaid, is necessary and is of a normal character.]
