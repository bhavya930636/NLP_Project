The Bombay General Clauses Act, 1904
(Bombay Act No. 1 of 1904)
Statement of Objects and Reasons. - Section 119 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 (XXXVII of 1956) continued in different territories of the States formed on the 1st November, 1956, the law which was in force therein immediately before that date. Consequently there were five different interpretation Acts which applied to the pre-State Reorganisation laws of the different areas forming parts of the new State of Bombay. It was found necessary to continue in force these different interpretation Acts not only for the interpretation of laws passed before 1st November, 1956 but also for the interpretation of amending laws that may be enacted after that date. It was also necessary to provide for the interpretation of Statewide laws of the new State of Bombay that may be enacted after the said date.
[Dated 30th May, 1904]
For Statement of Objects and Reasons, see Bombay Government Gazette, 1903, Part VII, pages 5, 6 ; for Report of Select Committee, see ibid., 1904, Part VII page 1, and for Proceedings in Council, see ibid., 1903, Part VII, page 130, ibid., 1904, Part VII, page 42.
