Rajasthan Excise Act, 1950
(Act No. 2 of 1950)
Last Updated 24th May, 2019
The Rajasthan Excise Act, 1950
Statement of objects and Reasons (Act No. 15 of 2011). - In order to bring unity of command in the Excise Department and to standardize the designations of excise officers it is proposed to amend sub-Section (1A) of Section 9.
The penalty in the existing provision of Section 57 of the Rajasthan Excise Act, 1950, for possessing any excisable article, after unlawfully importing it from other States, is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months or with fine which may extent to one thousand rupees or with both. This penalty does not match the severity of the offence of smuggling of excisable articles from other States and it is therefore proposed that the punishment for this offence should be imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to 3 years and with fine of twenty thousand rupees or five times of the loss of excise duty, which ever is higher and if the quantity of liquor exceeds 50 bulk litres then the punishment should be minimum sentence of imprisonment for three years extendable up to five years and with fine of twenty thousand rupees or ten times of the loss of excise duty whichever is higher. The proposed amendment will deter this offence.
Statement of objects and Reasons (Act No. 6 of 2007). - In has been noticed that the Rental Predominant System or the Exclusive Privilege Amount System of sale of liquor leads to a large number of problems like development of liquor mafia, cartelization for obtaining contracts at less than fair value, adoption of foul means to maximize profit etc. In view of this the State Government adopted Tax predominant System of sale of liquor (IMFL and Beer) in the State of Rajasthan for the year 2006-07. The need for improve enforcement for successful implementation of the new excise policy can hardly be over emphasized, as there is likelihood of unscrupulous elements attempting to smuggle and/or manufacture liquor illegally for quick gains. Accordingly, the Excise Preventive Force has been re-organized and strengthened by creating the post of Director, enforcement, Excise and various other posts. A large number of equipments have already been sanctioned for the force.
For the effective enforcement, it is necessary that the members of Excise Preventive Force be duly empowered and authorized to take effective action under the Act. Accordingly certain new offences are proposed to be created under the Act, the penal provisions are proposed to be made stringent by enhancing the penalty for the existing offences and by providing higher penalty for the newly created offences, the investigation procedure is proposed to be made simpler, the bail provisions are proposed to be made strict. Certain other provisions for disposal of seized liquor and property without interference of courts and tribunals, provisions for the punishment of the officers and employees of the Excise Department for assisting the offenders in contravention of the provisions of the Act, etc. are also proposed to be made.
The fines proposed therein are in proportion to the gravity of offence and the loss of revenue. Therefore, a provision has been proposed to be made to the effect that the fine realized under this Act shall be credited to the revenue of the Department so that the victims of the adulterated liquor could be adequately compensated.
A majority of the proposals are on the lines of the Modal Excise Act circulated in April, 2005 by the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Government of India.
The Bills seeks to achieve the aforesaid objectives.
