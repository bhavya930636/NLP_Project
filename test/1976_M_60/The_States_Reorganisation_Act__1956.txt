The States of India, as they exist today, have been formed largely as a result of historical accidents and circumstances, and there has, therefore, been a demand for the reorganisation of the component units of the Indian Union on a more rational basis, after taking into account not only the growing importance of the regional languages, but also financial, economic and administrative consideration. The States Reorganisation Commission was accordingly constituted in December, 1953, to investigate the conditions of this problem, the historical background, the existing situation and all other relevant factors, and to recommend the principles which could be considered appropriate as well as the broad lines on which particular Stales should he reorganized. The Commission reported on 30th September. 1955.

The Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands will also be treated as a Union territory. In view of the proposal for the amalgamation of Bihar and West Bengal which is under consideration, no provision has been made in this Bill for any territorial adjustments between these two States.
The Bill makes the necessary supplemental and incidental provisions relating to representation in Parliament and in the State Legislatures, establishment of high Courts apportionment of assets and liabilities and other matters.
