When upon an investigation made as aforesaid it appears to the Collector that an offence made under this Act has been committed and that anything seized under this Act is liable to be confiscated and it further appears that the offender is not known or cannot be found, the Collector shall inquire into and determine the case, and, if he finds that the thing is liable to confiscation under Section 68, shall order such confiscation :
Provided that no such order shall be made until the expiration of two months the date of seizing the thing intended to be confiscated or without hearing any person who may appear within the period and claim any right to such thing, and the evidence, if any, which he produces in support of his claim :
Provided further that if the thing in question is liable to speedy and natural decay, or if the Collector is of opinion that its sale would be for the benefit of the owner, the Collector may at any time direct it to be sold; and the provisions of this sub-section and sub-section (2) shall, as nearly as may be practicable, apply to the net proceeds of such sale.

And if in any such case any property has been seized as liable to confiscation under this Act, the Excise Commissioner or the Collector may release the same on receiving payment of the value thereof as estimated by him or of such smaller sum as he may think fit.
(2)
