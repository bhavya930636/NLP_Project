7. Persons competent to transfer.
- Every person competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, or authorised to dispose of transferable property not his own, is competent to transfer such property either wholly or in part, and either absolutely or conditionally, in the circumstances, to the extent and in the manner, allowed and prescribed by any law for the time being in force.
8. Operation of transfer.
- Unless a different intention is expressed or necessarily implied, a transfer of property passes forthwith to the transferee, all the interest which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property, and in the legal incidents thereof.

11. Restriction repugnant to interest created.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created absolutely in favour of any person, but the terms of the transfer direct that such interest shall be applied or enjoyed by him in a particular manner, he shall be entitled to receive and dispose of such interest as if there were no such direction.
[Where any such direction has been made in respect of one piece of immoveable property for the purpose of securing the beneficial enjoyment of another piece of such property, nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect any right which the transferor may have to enforce such direction or any remedy which he may have in respect of a breach thereof] [In section 11 second paragraph substituted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.].

13. Transfer for benefit of unborn persons.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not in existence at the date of the transfer, subject to a prior interest created by the same transfer, the interest created for the benefit of such person shall not take effect, unless it extends to the whole of the remaining interest of the transferor in the property.
Illustration
A transfers property of which he is the owner to B in trust for A and his intended wife successively for their lives, and, after the death of the survivor, for the eldest son of the intended marriage for life, and after his death for A's second son. The interest so created for the benefit of the eldest son does not take effect, because it does not extend to the whole of A's remaining interest in the property.
14. Rule against perpetuity.
- No transfer of property can operate to create an interest which is to take effect after the life-time of one or more person living at the date of such transfer, and the minority of some person who shall be in existence at the expiration of that period, and to whom, if he attains full age, the interest created is to belong.
15. Transfer to class some of whom come under sections 13 and 14.
- If, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a class of persons with regard to some of whom such interest fails by reason of any of the rules contained in sections 13 and 14, such interest fails [in regard to those persons only and not in regard to the whole class.] [In section 15 last words substituted for 'as regards the whole class' by Act VI of Samvat 1996.]
16. [ Transfer to take effect on failure of prior interest. [Sections 16, 17 and 18 substituted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.]
- Where, by reason of any of the rules contained in sections 13 and 14, and interest created for the benefit of a person or of a class of persons fails in regard to such person or the whole of such class, any interest created in the same transaction and intended to take effect after or upon failure of such prior interest also fails].
17. Direction for accumulation.
(1)
Where the terms of a transfer of a property direct that the income arising from the property shall be accumulated either wholly or in part during a period longer than-
(a)
the life of the transferor, or
(b)
a period of eighteen years from the date of the transfer, such direction shall, save as hereinafter provided, be void to the extent to which the period during which the accumulation is directed exceeds the longer of the aforesaid periods, and at the end of such last mentioned period the property and the income thereof shall be disposed of as if the period during which the accumulation has been directed to be made has elapsed.
(2)
This section shall not effect any direction for accumulation for the purpose of-
(i)
the payment of the debts of the transferor or any other person taking any interest under the transfer or
(ii)
the provision of portions for children or remoter issue of the transferor or of any other person taking any interest under the transfer ; or
(iii)
the preservation or maintenance of the property transferred ; and such direction may be made accordingly.]
18. Transfer in perpetuity for benefit of public.
- The restrictions in sections 14, 16 and 17 shall not apply in the case of a transfer of property for the benefit of the public in the advancement of religion, knowledge, commerce, health, safety or any other object beneficial to human or other living being.
19. Vested interest.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of a person without specifying the time when it is to take effect, or in terms specifying that it is to take effect forthwith or on the happening of an event which must happen, such interest is vested, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the transfer.
A vested interest is not defeated by the death of the transferee before he obtains possession.
Explanation. - An intention that an interest shall not be vested is not to be inferred merely from a provision whereby the enjoyment thereof is postponed, or whereby a prior interest in the same property is given or reserved to some other person, or whereby income arising from the property is directed to be accumulated until the time of enjoyment arrives, or from a provision that if a particular event shall happen the interest shall pass to another person.
20. When unborn person acquires vested interest on transfer for his benefit.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not then living, he acquires upon his birth, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the transfer, a vested interest, although he may not be entitled to the enjoyment thereof immediately on his birth
21. Contingent interest.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of a person to take effect only on the happening of a specified uncertain event, or if a specified uncertain event shall not happen, such person thereby acquires a contingent interest in the property. Such interest becomes a vested interest, in the former case, on the happening of the event, in the latter, when the happening of the event becomes impossible.
Exception. - Where, under a transfer of property, a person becomes entitled to an interest therein upon attaining a particular age, and the transferor also gives to him absolutely the income to arise from such interest before he reaches that age, or directs the income or so much thereof as may be necessary to be applied for his benefit, such interest is not contingent.
22. Transfer to member of a class who attain a particular age.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of such members only of a class as shall attain a particular age, such interest does not vest in any member of the class who has not attained that age.
23. Transfer contingent on happening of specified uncertain event.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is to acquire to a specified person if a specified uncertain event shall happen, and no time is mentioned for the occurrence of that event, the interest fails unless such event happens before, or at the same time, as the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist.
24. Transfer to such of certain person as survive at some period not specified.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is to accrue to such of certain persons as shall be surviving at some period, but the exact period is not specified, the interest shall go such of them as shall be alive when the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the transfer.
Illustration.
A transfers property to B for life, and after his death to C and D, equally to be divided between them, or to the survivor of them. C dies during the life of B. D survives B. At B's death the property passes to D.
25. Conditional transfer.
- An interest created on a transfer of property and dependent upon a condition fails if the fulfillment of the condition is impossible, or is forbidden by law, or is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, or is fraudulent, or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another, or the Court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy,-
(a)
A lets a farm to B on condition that he shall walk a hundred miles in an hour. The lease is void.
(b)
A gives Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall marry A's daughter C. At the date of the transfer C was dead. The transfer is void.
(c)
A transfer Rs. 500 to B on condition that she shall murder C. The transfer is void.
(d)
A transfer Rs. 500 to his niece C if she will desert her husband. The transfer is void.
26. Fulfillment of condition precedent.
- Where the terms of a transfer of property impose a condition to be fulfilled before a person can take an interest in the property, the condition shall be deemed to have been fulfilled if it has been substantially complied with.
Illustrations.
(a)
A transfers Rs. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D and E. E dies B marries with the consent of C and D. B is deemed to have fulfilled the conditions.
(b)
A transfer Rs. 5,000 to be on condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D and E. B marries without the consent of C, D and E but obtains their consent after the marriage. B has not fulfilled the condition.
27. Conditional transfer to one person coupled with transfer to another on failure of prior disposition.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of one person, and by the same transaction an ulterior disposition of the same interest is made in favour of another, if the prior disposition under the transfer shall fail, the ulterior disposition shall take effect upon the failure of the prior disposition, although the failure may not have occurred in the manner contemplated by the transfer.
But, where the intention of the parties to the transaction is that the ulterior disposition shall take effect only in the event of the prior disposition failing in a particular manner, the ulterior disposition shall not take effect unless the prior disposition fails in that manner.
Illustrations
(a)
A transfers Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall execute a certain lease within three months after A's death, and, if he should neglect to do so, to C. B dies in A's life-time. The disposition in favour of C takes effect.
(b)
A transfer property to his wife ; but, in case she should die in his life-time, transfers to B that which he had transferred to her. A and his wife perish together under circumstances which make it impossible to prove that she died before him. The disposition in favour of B does not take effect.
28. Ulterior transfer conditional on happening or not happening of specified event.
- On a transfer of property an interest therein may be created to accrue to any person with the condition superadded that in case a specified uncertain event shall happen such interest shall pass to another person, or that in case a specified uncertain even shall not happen such interest shall pass to another person. In each case the dispositions are subject to the rules contained in sections 10, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27.
29. Fulfilment of condition subsequent.
- An ulterior disposition of the kind contemplated by the last preceding section cannot take effect unless the condition is strictly fulfilled.
Illustration
A transfers Rs. 500 to B, to be paid to him on his attaining his majority or marrying, with a proviso that, if B dies a minor or marries without C's consent, the Rs. 500 shall go to D. B marries when only 17 years of age, without C's consent. The transfer to D takes effect.
30. Prior disposition not affected by invalidity of ulterior disposition.
- If the ulterior disposition is not valid, the prior disposition is not affected by it.
Illustration
A transfers a farm to B for her life, and if she do not desert her husband to C. B is entitled to the farm during her life as if no condition had been inserted.
31. Condition that transfer shall cease to have effect in case specified uncertain event happens or does not happen.
- Subject to the provision of section 12, on a transfer of property an interest therein may be created with the condition super added that it shall cease to exist in a case a specified uncertain event shall happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen.
Illustrations
(a)
A transfers a farm to B for his life, with a proviso that in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease to have any effect. B cuts down the wood. He loses his life interest in the farm.
(b)
A transfers a farm to B, provided that, if B shall not go to England within three years after the date of the transfer, his interest in the farm shall cease. B does not go to England within the terms prescribed. His interest in the farm ceases.
32. Such conditions must not be invalid.
- In order that a condition that an interest shall cease to exist may be valid, it is necessary that the event to which it relates be one which could legally constitute the condition of the creation of an interest.
33. Transfer conditional on performance of act, no time being specified for performance.
- Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created subject to a condition that the person taking it shall perform a certain act, but no time is specified for the performance of the act, the condition is broken when he renders impossible, permanently or for an indefinite period, the performance of the act.
34. Transfer conditional on performance of act, time being specified.
- Where an act is to be performed by a person either as a condition to be fulfilled before an interest created on a transfer of property is enjoyed by him, or as a condition on the non-fulfillment of which the interest is to pass from him to another person, and a time is specified for the performance of the act, if such performance within the specified time is prevented by the fraud of a person who would be directly benefited by non-fulfilment of the condition, such further time shall as against him be allowed for performing the act as shall be requisite to make up for the delay caused by such fraud. But if no time is specified for the performance of the act, then, if its performance is by the fraud of a person interested in the non-fulfilment of the condition rendered impossible or indefinitely postponed, the condition shall as against him be deemed to have been fulfilled.
Election
35. Election when necessary.
- Where a person professes to transfer property which he has no right to transfer, and as part of the same transaction confers any benefit on the owner of the property, such owner must elect either to confirm such transfer or to dissent from it ;
and in the latter case he shall relinquish the benefit so conferred, and the benefit so relinquished shall revert to the transferor or his representative as if it had not been disposed of,
subject nevertheless,
where the transfer is gratuitous, and the transferor has, before the election, died or otherwise become incapable of making a fresh transfer,
and in all cases where the transfer is for consideration,
to the charge of making good to the disappointed transferee the amount or value of the property attempted to be transferred to him.
Illustration.
The farm of Sultanpur is the property of C and worth Rs. 800. A by an instrument of gift professes to transfer it to B, giving by the same instrument Rs. 1,000 to C. C elects to retain the farm. He forfeits the gift of Rs. 1,000.
In the same case, A dies before the election. His representative must out of the Rs. 1,000 pay Rs. 800 to B.
The rule in the first paragraph of this section applies whether the transferor does or does not believe that which he professes to transfer to be his own.
A person taking no benefit directly under a transaction, but deriving a benefit under it indirectly, need not elect.
A person who in his own capacity takes a benefit under the transaction may in another dissent therefrom.
Exception to the last preceding four rules. - Where a particular benefit is expressed to be conferred on the owner of the property which the transferor professes to transfer, and such benefit is expressed to be in lieu of that property, if such owner claim the property, he must relinquish the particular benefit, but he is not bound to relinquish any other benefit conferred upon him by the same transaction.
Acceptance of the benefit by the person on whom it is conferred constitutes an election by him to confirm the transfer, if he is aware of his duty to elect and of those circumstances which would influence the judgment of a reasonable man in making an election, or if he waives enquiry into the circumstances.
Such knowledge or waiver shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed, if the person on whom the benefit has been conferred has enjoyed it for two years without doing any act to express dissent.
Such knowledge or waiver may be inferred from any act of his which renders it impossible to place the persons interested in the property professed to be transferred in the same condition as if such act had not been done.
Illustration
A transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same transaction gives C a coal-mine. C takes possession of the mine and exhausts it. He has thereby confirmed the transfer of the estate to B.
If he does not within one year after the date of the transfer signify to the transferor or his representatives his intention to confirm or to dissent from the transfer, the transferor or his representatives may, upon the expiration of that period, require him to make his election ; and, if he does not comply with such requisition within a reasonable time after he has received it, he shall be deemed to have elected to confirm the transfer.
In case of disability, the election shall be postponed until the disability ceases, or until the election is made by some competent authority.
Apportionment.
36. Apportionment of periodical payments on determination of interest of person entitled.
- In the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary, all rents, annuities, pensions, dividends and other periodical payments in the nature of income shall, upon the transfer of the interest of the person entitled to receive such payments, be deemed, as between the transferor and transferee, to accrue due from day to day, and to be apportionable accordingly, but to be payable on the days appointed for the payment thereof.
37. Apportionment of benefit of obligation on severance.
- When, in consequence of a transfer, property is divided and held in several shares, and thereupon the benefit of any obligation relating to the property as a whole passes from one to several owners of the property, the corresponding duty shall, in the absence of a contract to the contrary amongst the owners, be performed in favour of each of such owners in proportion to the value of his share in the property ; provided that the duty can be severed and that the severance does not substantially increase the burden of the obligation ; but if the duty cannot be severed, or if the severance would substantially increase the burden of the obligation, the duty shall be performed for the benefit of such one of the several owners as they shall jointly designate for that purpose :
Provided that no person on whom the burden of the obligation lies shall be answerable for failure to discharge it in manner provided by this section, unless and until he has had reasonable notice of the severance.
Nothing in this section applies to leases for agricultural purposes unless and until [the Government] [Substituted by Act VII of Samvat 2001 for 'His Highness'] by notification in the Government Gazette so directs.
Illustrations.
(a)
A sells to B, C and D a house situate in a village and leased to E at an annual rent of Rs. 30 and delivery of one fat sheep, B having provided half the purchase money and C and D one quarter each. E, having notice of this, must pay Rs. 15 to B, Rs. 7 ½ to C and Rs. 7½ to D and must deliver the sheep according to the joint direction of B, C and D.
(b)
In the same case, each house in the village being bound to provide ten day's labour each year on a work to prevent inundation, E had agreed as a term of his lease to perform this work for A. B, C and D, severally require E to perform the ten day's work due on account of the house of each. E is not bound to do more than ten day's work in all, according to such directions as B, C and D may join in giving.
(B)
Transfer of Immovable Property
38. Transfer by person authorised only under certain circumstances to transfer.
- Where any person, authorised only under circumstances in their nature variable to dispose of immovable property, transfers such property for consideration, alleging the existence of such circumstances, they shall, as between the transferee on the one part and the transferor and other person (if any) affected by the transfer on the other part, be deemed to have existed, if the transferee, after using reasonable care to ascertain the existence of such circumstances, has acted in good faith.
Illustration
A, a Hindu widow, whose husband has left collateral heirs, alleging that the property held by her as such is insufficient for her maintenance, agrees, for purposes neither religious nor charitable, to sell a field, part of such property, to B. B satisfies himself by reasonable enquiry that the income of the property is insufficient for A's maintenance, and that the sale of the field is necessary, and, acting in good faith, buy the field from A. As between B on the one part and A and the collateral heirs on the other part, a necessity for the sale shall be deemed to have existed.
39. Transfer where third person is entitled to maintenance.
- Where a third person has a right to receive maintenance, or a provision for advancement or marriage, from the profits of immovable property, and such property is transferred [x x x x] [In section 39 words 'with the intention of defeating such right' omitted and for the words 'of such intention' the word 'thereof' substituted and illustration omitted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.], the right may be enforced against the transferee, if he has notice [thereof] [In section 39 words 'with the intention of defeating such right' omitted and for the words 'of such intention' the word 'thereof' substituted and illustration omitted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.] or if the transfer is gratuitous ; but not against a transferee for consideration and without notice of the right, nor against such property in his hands.
[ * * * * * ] [ In section 39 words 'with the intention of defeating such right' omitted and for the words 'of such intention' the word 'thereof' substituted and illustration omitted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.]
40. Burden of obligation imposing restriction on use of land.
- or of obligation annexed to ownership but not amounting to interest or easement. - Where, for the more beneficial enjoyment of his own immovable property, a third person has, independently of any interest in the immovable property of another or of any easement thereon, a right to restrain the enjoyment [in a particular manner of the latter property] [In section 40 words in brackets substituted for the words 'of the latter property or to compel its enjoyment in particular manner' by Act VI of Samvat 1996.], or where a third person is entitled to the benefit of an obligation arising out of contract and annexed to the ownership of immovable property, but not amounting to an interest therein or easement thereon, such right or obligation may be enforced against a transferee with notice thereof or a gratuitous transferee of the property affected thereby, but not against a transferee for consideration and without notice of the right or obligation, nor against such property in his hands.
Illustration.
A contracts to sell Sultanpur to B. While the contract is still in force he sells Sultanpur to C, who has notice of the contract. B may enforce the contract against C to the same extent as against A.
41. Transfer by ostensible owner.
- Where, with the consent, express or implied, of the persons interested in immovable property a person is the ostensible owner of such property and transfers the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be voidable on the ground that the transferor was not authorised to make ; provided that the transferee after taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor, had power to make the transfer, has acted in good faith.
42. Transfer by person having authority to revoke former transfer.
- Where a person transfers any immovable property, reserving power to revoke the transfer, and subsequently transfers the property for consideration to another transferee, such transfer operates in favour of such transferee (subject to any condition attached to the exercise of the power) as a revocation of the former transfer to the extent of the power.
Illustration.
A lets a house to B, and reserves power to revoke the lease if, in the opinion of a specified surveyor, B should make a use of it detrimental to its value. Afterwards A, thinking that such a use has been made, lets the house to C. This operates as a revocation of B's lease subject to the opinion of the surveyor as to B's use of the house having been detrimental to its value.
43. Transfer by unauthorised person who subsequently acquires interest in property transferred.
- Where a person [fraudulently or] [In section 43 words in brackets inserted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.] erroneously represents that he is authorised to transfer certain immovable property and professes to transfer such property for consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any time during which the contract of transfer subsists.
Nothing in this section shall impair the right of transferees in good faith for consideration without notice of the existence of the said option.
Illustration
A, a Hindu, who has separated from his father, B, sells to C three fields, X, Y and Z, representing that A is authorised to transfer the same. Of these fields Z does not belong to A, it having been retained by B on the partition ; but on B's dying A as heir obtains Z. C, not having rescinded the contract of sale, may require A to deliver Z to him.
44. Transfer by one co-owner.
- Where one of two or more coowners of immovable property legally competent in that behalf transfers his share of such property or any interest therein, the transferee acquires, as to such share of interest, and so far as is necessary to give effect to the transfer, the transferor's right to joint possession or other common or part enjoyment of the property, and to enforce a partition of the same, but subject to the conditions and liabilities affecting, at the date of the transfer, the share or interest so transferred.
Where the transferee of a share of a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family is not a member of the family, nothing in this section shall be deemed to entitle him to join possession or other common or part enjoyment of the house.
45. Joint transfer for consideration.
- Where immovable property is transferred for consideration to two or more persons, and such consideration is paid out of a fund belonging to them in common, they are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, respectively entitled to interests in such property identical, as nearly as may be, with the interests to which they were respectively entitled in the fund ; and, where such consideration is paid out of separate funds belonging to them respectively, they are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary respectively entitled to interests in such property in proportion to the shares of the consideration which they respectively advanced.
In the absence of evidence as to the interests in the fund to which they were respectively entitled, or as to the shares which they respectively advanced, such persons shall be presumed to be equally interested in the property.
46. Transfer for consideration by persons having distinct interests.
- Where immovable property is transferred for consideration by persons having distinct interests therein, the transferors are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, entitled to share in the consideration equally, where their interests in the property were of equal value, and, where such interests were of unequal value, proportionately to the value of their respective interests.
Illustrations
(a)
A, owning a moiety, and B and C each a quarter share, of mauza Sultanpur, exchange an eight share of the mauza for quarter share of mauza Lalpura. There being no agreement to the contrary, A is entitled to an eighth share in Lalpura, and B and C each to a sixteenth share in that mauza.
(b)
A, being entitled to a life-interest in mauza Atrali and B and C to the reversion, sell the mauza for Rs. 1,000 A's life-interest is ascertained to be worth Rs. 600, the revision Rs. 400. A is entitled to receive Rs. 600 out of the purchase money, B and C to receive Rs. 400.
47. Transfer by co-owners of share in common property.
- Where several co-owners of immovable property transfer a share therein without specifying that the transfer is to take effect on any particular share or shares of the transferors, the transfer, as among such transferors, takes effect on such shares equally where the shares were equal, and were they were unequal, proportionately to the extent of such shares.
Illustration.
A, the owner of an-eight-anna share, and B and C, each the owner of a four-anna share, in mauza Sultanpur, transfer a two anna share in the mauza to D, without specifying from which of their several shares the transfer is made. To give effect to the transfer one anna share is taken from the share of A, and half an anna share from each of the shares of B and C.
48. Priority of rights created by transfer.
- Where a person purports to create by transfer at different times rights in or over the same immovable property, and such rights cannot all exist or be exercised to their full extent together, each later created right shall, in the absence of a special contract or reservation binding the earlier transferees, be subject to the rights previously treated.
49. Transferee's right under policy.
- Where immovable property is transferred for consideration, and such property or any part thereof is at the date of the transfer insured against loss or damage by fire, the transferee, in case of such loss or damage, may, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, require any money which the transferor actually receives under the policy, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to be applied in reinstating the property.
50. Rent bona fide paid to holder under defective title.
- No person shall be chargeable with any rents of profits of any immovable property, which he has in good faith paid or delivered to any person of whom he in good faith held such property, notwithstanding it may afterwards appear that the person to whom such payment or delivery was made had no right to receive such rents or profits.
Illustration.
A lets a field to B at a rent of Rs. 50, and then transfers the field to C. B, having no notice of the transfer, in good faith pays the rent to A, B is not chargeable with the rent so paid.
51. Improvements made by bona fide holders under defective titles.
- When the transferee of immovable property makes any improvement on the property, believing in good faith that he is absolutely entitled thereto, and he is subsequently evicted therefrom by any person having a better title, the transferee has a right to require the person causing the eviction either to have the value of the improvement estimated and paid or secured to the transferee, or to sell his interest in the property to the transferee at the then market value thereof, irrespective of the value of such improvement.
The amount to be paid or secured in respect of such improvement shall be the estimated value thereof at the time of the eviction.
When, under the circumstances aforesaid, the transferee has planted or sown on the property crops which are growing when he is evicted therefrom, he is entitled to such crops and to free ingress and egress to gather and carry them.
52. [ Transfer of property pending suit relating thereto. [In section 52 word 'pendency' and 'any' substituted for 'active prosecution' and 'a contentious' respectively ; other words in brackets inserted and explanation added by Act VI of Samvat 1996.]
- During the [pendency] in any Court having authority in the State, of [any] [In section 52 word 'pendency' and 'any' substituted for 'active prosecution' and 'a contentious' respectively ; other words in brackets inserted and explanation added by Act VI of Samvat 1996.] suit or proceeding [which is not collusive and] [In section 52 word 'pendency' and 'any' substituted for 'active prosecution' and 'a contentious' respectively ; other words in brackets inserted and explanation added by Act VI of Samvat 1996.] in which any right to immovable property is directly and specifically in question, the property cannot be transferred or otherwise dealt with by any party to the suit or proceeding so as to affect the rights of any other party thereto under any decree or order which may be made therein, except under the authority of the Court and on such terms as it may impose.
[Explanation. - For the purposes of this section, the pendency of a suit or proceeding shall be deemed to commence from the date of the presentation of the plaint or the institution of the proceeding in a Court of competent jurisdiction, and to continue until the suit or proceeding has been disposed of by a final decree or order and completes satisfaction or discharge of such decree or order has been obtained, or has become unobtainable by reason of the expiration of any period of limitation prescribed for the execution thereof by any law for the time being in force.] [In section 52 word 'pendency' and 'any' substituted for 'active prosecution' and 'a contentious' respectively ; other words in brackets inserted and explanation added by Act VI of Samvat 1996.]
53. [ Fraudulent transfer. [Section 53 substituted ibid.]
(1)
Every transfer of immovable property made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the transferor shall be voidable at the option of any creditor so defeated or delayed.
Nothing in this sub-section shall impair the rights of a transferee in good faith and for consideration.
Nothing in this sub-section shall affect any law for the time being in force relating to insolvency.
A suit instituted by a creditor (which term includes a decree-holder whether he has or has not applied for execution of his decree) to avoid a transfer on the ground that it has been made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the transferor, shall be instituted on behalf of, or for the benefit of, all the creditors.
(2)
Every transfer of immovable property made without consideration with intent to defraud a subsequent transferee shall be voidable at the option of such transferee.
For the purposes of this sub-section, no transfer made without consideration shall be deemed to have been made with intent to defraud by reason only that a subsequent transfer for consideration was made.]
Chapter III
Of Sales of Immovable Property
54. "Sale" defined.
- "Sale" is a transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or promised or part-paid and part-promised.
Sale how made. - Such transfer, in the case of tangible immovable property or in the case of a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument.
Contract of sale. - A contract for the sale of immovable property is contract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms settled between the parties, but no such contract shall be valid, unless it is in writing, and signed by the parties.
It does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property.
55. Rights and liabilities of buyer and seller.
- In the absence of contract to the contrary, the buyer and the seller of immovable property respectively are subject to the liabilities, and have the rights, mentioned in the rules next following, or such of them as are applicable to the property sold :-
(1)
The seller is bound-
(a)
to disclose to the buyer any material defect in the property [or in the seller's title thereto] [In section 55 (1) (a) words in brackets inserted by the Act VI of 1996.] of which the seller is, and the buyer is not aware, and which the buyer could not with ordinary care discover ;
(b)
to produce to the buyer on his request for examination all documents of title relating to the property which are in the seller's possession or power ;
(c)
to answer to the best of his information all relevant questions put to him by the buyer in respect to the property or the title thereto ;
(d)
on payment or tender of the amount due in respect of the price, to execute a proper conveyance of the property when the buyer tenders it to him for execution at a proper time and place ;
(e)
between the date of the contract of sale and the delivery of the property, to take as much care of the property and all documents of title relating thereto which are in his possession as an owner of ordinary prudence would take of such property and documents ;
(f)
to give, on being so required, the buyer, or such person as he directs, such possession of the property as its nature admits ;
(g)
to pay all public charges and rent accrued due in respect of the property up to the date of the sale, the interest on all incumbrances on such property due on such date, and, except where the property is sold subject to incumbrances, to discharge all incumbrances on the property then existing.
(2)
The seller shall be deemed to contract with the buyer that the interest which the seller professes to transfer to the buyer subsists and that he has power to transfer the same :
Provided that, where the sale is made by a person in a fiduciary character, he shall be deemed to contract with the buyer that the seller has done no act where by the property is encumbered or whereby he is hindered from transferring it.
The benefit of contract mentioned in this rule shall be annexed to, and shall go with, the interest of the transferee as such, and may be enforced by every person in whom that interest is for the whole or any part thereof from time to time vested.
(3)
Where the whole of the purchase-money has been paid to the seller, he is also bound to deliver to the buyer all documents of title relating to the property which are in the seller's possession or power :
Provided that, (a) where the seller retains any part of the property comprised in such documents, he is entitled to retain them all, and, (b) where the whole of such property is sold to different buyers, the buyer of the lot of greatest value is entitled to such documents. But in case (a) the seller, and in case (b) the buyer, of the lot of greatest value, is bound, upon every reasonable request by the buyer, or by any of the other buyers, as the case may be, and at the cost of the person making the request, to produce the said documents and furnish such true copies thereof or extracts therefrom as he may require ; and in the meantime, the seller, or the buyer of the lot of greatest value, as the case may be, shall keep the said documents safe, uncancelled and undefaced, unless prevented from so doing by fire or other inevitable accident.
(4)
The seller is entitled-
(a)
to the rents and profits of the property till the ownership thereof passes to the buyer ;
(b)
where the ownership of the property has passed to the buyer before payments of the whole of the purchase-money, to a charge upon the property in the hands of the buyer, [any transferee without consideration or any transferee with notice of the non-payment] [In section 55 (4) (b) words in brackets inserted by the Act VI of Samvat 1996.], for the amount of the purchase-money, or any part thereof remaining unpaid, and for interest on such amount or part 1[from the date on which possession has delivered.]
(5)
The buyer is bound-
(a)
to disclose to the seller any fact as to the nature or extent of the seller's interest in the property of which the buyer is aware but of which he has reason to believe that the seller is not aware, and which materially increase the value of such interest ;
(b)
to pay or tender, at the time and place completing the sale ; the purchase-money to the seller or such person as he directs ; provided that, where the property is sold free from encumbrances, the buyer may retain out of the purchase-money the amount of any incumbrances on the property existing at the date of the sale, and shall pay the amount so retained to the persons entitled thereto ;
(c)
where the ownership of the property has passed to the buyer, to bear any loss arising from the destruction, injury or decrease in value of the property not caused by the seller ;
(d)
where the ownership of the property has passed to the buyer, as between himself and the seller, to pay all public charges and rent which may become payable in respect of the property, the principal moneys due on any incumbrances subject to which the property is sold, and the interest thereon afterwards accruing due.
(6)
The buyer is entitled-
(a)
where the ownership of the property has passed to him, to the benefit of any improvement in, or increase in value of, the property, and to the rents and profits thereof ;
(b)
unless he has improperly declined to accept delivery of the property, to a charge on the property, as against the seller and all persons claiming under him [xxxx] [ Words 'with notice of the payment' omitted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.], to the extent of the seller's interest in the property, for the amount of any purchase-money properly paid by the buyer in anticipation of the delivery and for interest on such amount ; and, when he properly declines to accept the delivery, also for the earnest (if any) and for the costs (if any) awarded to him of a suit to compel specific performance of the contract or to obtain a decree for its recisions.
An omission to make such disclosures as are mentioned in this section, paragraph (1), clause (a), and paragraph (5), clause (a) is fraudulent.
56. [ Marshalling by subsequent purchaser. [Section 56 substituted ibid.]
- If the owner of two or more properties mortgages them to one person and then sells one or more of the properties to another person, the buyer is, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, entitled to have the mortgageddebt satisfied out of the property or properties not sold to him, so far as the same will extend, but not so as to prejudice the rights of the mortgagee or persons claiming under him or of any other person who has for consideration acquired an interest in any of the properties.]
Discharge of Incumbrances on Sale.
57. Provision by Court for incumbrances and sale freed therefrom.
(a)
Where immovable property subject to any incumbrances, whether immediately payable or not, is sold by the Court or in execution of a decree, or out of Court, the Court may, if it thinks fit, on the application of any party to the sale, direct or allow payment into Court,-
(1)
in case of an annual or monthly sum charged on the property, or of a capital sum charged on a determinable interest in the property- of such amount as, when invested in securities of the Government of India, or of the State, the Court considers will be sufficient, by means of the interest thereof, to keep down or otherwise provide for that charge ; and
(2)
in any other case of a capital sum charged on the property- of the amount sufficient to meet the incumbrance and any interest due thereon.
But in either case there shall also be paid into Court such additional amount as the Court considers will be sufficient to meet the contingency of further costs, expenses and interest, and any other contingency, except depreciation of investments, not exceeding one-tenth part of the original amount to be paid in, unless the Court for special reasons (which it shall record) thinks fit to require a larger additional amount.
(b)
Thereupon the Court may, if it thinks fit, and after notice to the incumbrancer, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, thinks fit to dispense with such notice, declare the property to be freed from the incumbrance, and make any order for conveyance, or vesting order, proper for giving effect to the sale, and give directions for the retention and investment of the money in Court.
(c)
After notice served on the persons interested in or entitled to the money or fund in Court, the Court may direct payment or transfer thereof to the persons entitled to receive or give a discharge for the same, and generally may give directions repecting the application or distribution of the capital or income thereof.
(d)
An appeal shall lie from any declaration, order or direction under this section as if the same were a decree.
(e)
In this section "Court" means (1) the High Court in the exercise of extraordinary original civil jurisdiction, (2) the Court of a District Judge within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property or any part thereof is situate, (3) any other Court which [the Government] [Substituted by Act VII of Samvat 2001 for 'His Highness'] may, from time to time by notification in the Jammu and Kashmir Government Gazette, declare to be competent to exercise the jurisdiction conferred by this section.
Chapter IV
Of Mortgages of Immovable Property and Charges
58. "Mortgage", "mortgagor", "mortgagee", "mortgage money" and "mortgage-deed" defined.
(a)
A mortgage is the transfer of an interest in specific immovable property for the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way of loan, an existing or future debt, or the performance of an engagement which may give rise to a pecuniary liability.
The transferor is called a mortgagor, the transferee a mortgagee ; the principal money and interest of which payment is secured for the time being are called the mortagage-money , and the instrument [**] [In section 58 in clause (a) '(if any)' omitted, proviso to clause (c) added and in clause (d) first words in brackets inserted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.] by which the transfer is effected is called a mortgage-deed.
(b)
Simple mortgage. - Where, without delivering possession of the mortgaged property, the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the mortgage-money, and agrees, expressly or impliedly, that, in the event of his failing to pay according to his contract, the mortagee shall have a right to cause the mortgaged property to be sold and the proceeds of sale to be applied, so far as may be necessary, in payment of the mortgage-money, the transaction is called a simple mortgage and the mortgagee a simple mortgage.
(c)
Mortgage by conditional sale. - Where the mortgagor ostensibly sells the mortgaged property-
on condition that on default of payment of mortgage-money on a certain date the sale shall become absolute ; or
on condition that on such payment being made the sale shall become void ; or
on condition that on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller ;
the transaction is called a mortgage by conditional sale and the mortgagee a mortgagee by conditional sale :
[Provided that no such transaction shall be deemed to be a mortgage, unless the condition is embodied in the document which effects or purports to effect the sale.] [In section 58 in clause (a) '(if any)' omitted, proviso to clause (c) added and in clause (d) first words in brackets inserted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.]

(e)
[ English mortgage.-Where the mortgagor binds himself to repay the mortgage-money on a certain date, and transfer the mortgaged property absolutely to the mortgagee, but subject to a proviso that he will re-transfer it to the mortgagor upon payment of the mortgage-money as agreed, the transaction is called an English mortgage. [Clauses (e), (f) and (g) inserted by Act X of Samvat 1966.]
(f)
Mortgage by deposit of title-deeds.-Where a person in any of the [Municipal Corporation Limits of Jammu and Srinagar and other Municipalties/areas which the Government may by notification in the Government Gazette specify] and in any other town which the Government may by notification in the Government Gazette, specify in this behalf, delivers to a creditor or his agent documents of title to immovable property, which intent to create a security thereon, the transaction is called a mortgage by deposit of the title-deeds.
(g)
Anomolous mortgage.-A mortgage which is not a simple mortgage, a mortgage by conditional sale, a usufructuary mortgage, an English mortgage or a mortgage by deposit of title-deeds within the meaning of this section, is called an anomolous mortgage.]
59. Mortgage when to be by assurance.
- [A mortage except the mortgage by deposit of title deeds in favour of financial institutions] [Substituted by Act XXIX of 2002] can be effected only by a registered instrument signed by the mortgagor and attested by at least two witnesses.
A person is said to attest a document when he signs it as a witness after seeing the executant sign it, or on receiving from the executant or if the executant is a parda nashin female, from herself after proper identification and acknowledgment that the executant has signed the document.

Rights and Liabilities of Mortgagor.
60. Right of mortgagor to redeem.
- At any time after the principal money has become [due] [In section 60 'due' substituted for 'payable' , words in brackets in line five substituted for the words 'the mortgage deed, if any, to the mortgage', words (where the mortgage has been effected by a registered deed) omitted, word 'decree' substituted for 'under' and word 'only' inserted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.], the mortgagor has a right, on payment or tender, at a proper time and place, of the motgaged money, to require the mortgagee (a) to deliver 1[to the mortgagor the mortgage-deed and all documents relating to the mortgaged-property which are in possession or power of the mortgagee], (b) where the mortgagee is in possession of the mortgaged property, to deliver possession thereof to the mortgagor, and (c) at the cost of the mortgagor either to re-transfer the mortgaged-property to him or to such third person as he may direct, or to execute and [ x x x ] [In section 60 'due' substituted for 'payable' , words in brackets in line five substituted for the words 'the mortgage deed, if any, to the mortgage', words (where the mortgage has been effected by a registered deed) omitted, word 'decree' substituted for 'under' and word 'only' inserted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.] to have registered an acknowledgment in writing that any right in derogation of his interest transferred to the mortgagee has been extinguished :
Provided that the right conferred by this section has not been extinguished by the act of the parties or by 1[decree] of a Court.
The right conferred by this section is called a right to redeem and a suit to enforce it is called a suit for redemption.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to render invalid any provision to the effect that, if the time fixed for payment of the principal money has been allowed to pass or no such time has been fixed, the mortgagee shall be entitled to reasonable notice before payment or tender of such money.
Redemption of portion of mortgaged property. - Nothing in this section shall entitle a person interested in a share only of the mortgaged property to redeem his own share only, on payment of a proportionate part of the amount remaining due on the mortgage, except [only] [In section 60 'due' substituted for 'payable' , words in brackets in line five substituted for the words 'the mortgage deed, if any, to the mortgage', words (where the mortgage has been effected by a registered deed) omitted, word 'decree' substituted for 'under' and word 'only' inserted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.] where a mortgagee, or, if there are more mortgagees than one, all such mortgagees, has or have acquired in whole or in part, the share of a mortgagor.
60A. [ Obligation to transfer to third party instead of re-transference to mortgagor. [Section 60-A and 60-B added and section 61 substituted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.]
(1)
Where a mortgagor is entitled to redemption, then, on the fulfilment of any conditions on the fulfilment of which he would be entitled to require a re-transfer, he may require the mortgagee, instead of re-transferring the property, to assign the mortgage debt and transfer of mortgaged property to such third person as the mortgagor may direct ; and the mortgagee shall be bound to assign and transfer accordingly.
(2)
The rights conferred by this section belong to and may be enforced by the mortgagor or by any encumbrancer notwithstanding an intermediate encumbrance ; but the requisition of any encumbrancer shall prevail over a requisition of the mortgagor and, as between encumbrancers, the requisition of a prior encumbrancer shall prevail over that of a subsequent encumbrancer.
(3)
The provisions of this section do not apply in the case of a mortgagee who is or has been in possession.] [Added ibid.]
60B. Right to inspection and production of documents.
- A mortgagor, as long his right of redemption subsists, shall be entitled at all reasonable times, at his request and at his own cost and on payment of the mortgagee's costs, and expenses in his behalf, to inspect and make copies or abstracts of, or extracts from, documents of title relating to the mortgage property which are in the custody or power of the mortgagee.
61. Right to redeem separately or simultaneously.
- A mortgagor who has executed two or more mortgages in favour of the same mortgagee shall, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, when the principal money of any two or more of the mortgages has become due, be entitled to redeem any one such mortgage separately, or any two or more of such mortgages together.
62. Right of usufructuary mortgagor to recover possession.
- In the case of a usufructuary mortgage, the mortgagor has a right to recover possession of the property [together with the mortgage deed and all documents relating to the mortgaged property which are in the possession or power of the mortgagee] [Inserted by Act VI of Samvat 1996.],-
(a)
where the mortgagee is authorised to pay himself the mortgage-money from the rents and profits of the property,- when such money is paid.
(b)
where the mortgagee is authorised to pay himself from such rents and profits [or any part thereof a part only of the mortgage-money] [Substituted for the words 'the interest principal money' Act VI of Samvat 1996.],-when the term, if any, prescribed for the payment of the mortgage-money has expired and the mortgagor pays or tenders to the mortgagee [the mortgage-money or the balance thereof] [Substituted for the words 'the principal money' Act VI of Samvat 1996.] or deposits it in Court as hereinafter provided.
63. Accession to mortgaged property.
- Where mortgaged property in possession of the mortgagee has, during the continuance of the mortgage, received any accession, the mortgagor, upon redemption, shall, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, be entitled as against the mortgagee to such accession.
Accession acquired in virtue of transfered ownership. - Where such accession has been acquired at the expense of the mortgagee, and is capable of separate possession or enjoyment without detriment to the principal property, the mortgagor desiring to take the accession must pay to the mortgagee the expense of acquiring it. If such separate possession or enjoyment is not possible, the accession must be delivered with the property ; the mortgagor being liable, in the case of an acquisition necessary to preserve the property from destruction, forfeiture or sale, or made with his assent, to pay the proper cost thereof, as an addition to the principal money, at the same rate of interest.
In the case last mentioned the profits, if any, arising from the accession shall be credited to the mortgagor.
Where the mortgage is usufructuary and the accession has been acquired at the expense of the mortgagee, the profits, if any, arising from the accession shall, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, be set off against interest, if any, payable on the money so expended.
