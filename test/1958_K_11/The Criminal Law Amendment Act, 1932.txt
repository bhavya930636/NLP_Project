The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932
(23 of 1932)
108.
The Civil Disobedience Movement ha made it necessary to supplement the Criminal Law by means of certain Ordinances promulgated by the Governor-General in exercise of his powers under Section 72 of the Government of India Act. The Special Powers Ordinances, expires on the 29th December, 1932. Though the Ordinances have enable Local Governments and their officers to control the movement, its organisers have not yet abandoned their attempt to paralyse Government and to conerce law-abiding citizens. The experience of the last two years and of previous movements on the same lines shows that, in the absence of certain of powers at present existing, it is no difficult matter to start or revive such subversive movements. The conditions prevailing at present as a result of measures taken by the Government of India and Local Governments are such as to render it unnecessary to assume for the whole of British India all the powers conferred by the Special Powers Ordinance now in force, and it is hoped that the powers conferred by Chapter II (Emergency Powers), Chapter IV (Special Courts) and Chapter V (Special provisions against instigation to the illegal refusal of the payment of certain liabilities) will only be needed in certain provinces. It is, therefore, intended by this Bill to take only those powers which a general review of the situation shows are required for the whole of India, and to leave it to the Local Governments to supplement these provisions by means of local legislation in order to meet local or emergency conditions.
The present Bill reproduces in the form of amendments to Acts already on the status-book, certain provisions of the Special Powers Ordinance (10 of 1932) and includes:
(a) provisions against associations dangerous to the public peace.
(b) provisions against certain forms of intimidation
(c) provisions to secure great control over the Press.
