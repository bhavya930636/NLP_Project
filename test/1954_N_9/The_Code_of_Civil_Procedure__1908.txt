Effect of set-off.-The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgment in respect both of the original claim and of the set-off : but this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to him under the decree.
(3)

Illustrations
(a)
A bequeaths Rs. 2,000 to B and appoints C his executor and residuary legatee. B dies and D takes out administration to B's effect, C pays Rs. 1,000 as surety for D: then D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000 against the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the same character with respect to the legacy as they fill with respect to the payment of Rs. 1,000.
(b)
A dies intestate and in debt to B. C takes out administration to A's effects and B buys part of the effects from C. In a suit for the purchase-money by C against B, the latter cannot set-off the debt against the price, for C fills two different characters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as representative to A.
(c)
A sues B on a bill of exchange. B alleges that A has wrongfully neglected to insure B's goods and is liable to him in compensation which he claims to set-off. The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off.
(d)
A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs. 500. B holds a judgment against A for Rs. 1,000. The two claims being both definite, pecuniary demands may be set-off.
(e)
A sues B for compensation on account of trespass. B holds a promissory note for Rs. 1,000 from A and claims to set-off that amount against any sum that A may recover in the suit. B may do so, for as soon as A recovers, both sums are definite pecuniary demands.
(f)
A and B sue C for Rs. 1,000 C cannot set-off a debt due to him by A alone.
(g)
A sues B and C for Rs. 1000. B cannot set-off a debt due to him alone by A.
(h)
A owes the partnership firm of B and C Rs. 1,000 B dies, leaving C surviving. A sues C for a debt of Rs.1,500 due in his separate character. C may set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000.

"ORDER VIII-A
THIRD PARTY PROCEDURE
1. (1) Where in respect of the claim made against him in the suit, a defendant claims to be entitled to contribution from or indemnity against any person not already a party to the suit (hereinafter called the third party) he may, by leave of Court, issue a notice (hereinafter called the third party notice) to that effect, sealed with the seal of the Court.
(2) An application for leave to issue such notice shall be filed along with the written statement of the said defendant and be accompanied by a draft of the notice sought to be issued. The notice shall state the nature and grounds of the claim and when the draft of the same is approved by Court with or without corrections, it shall be served on the third partytogether with a copy of the plaint and a copy of the said defendant's written statement in the manner prescribed for the service of summons.
2.
(1) If on being served with such notice the third party does not enter appearance on or before the date fixed therein for his appearance, he shall be deemed to admit the validity of the decree that may be passed against the defendant, on whose behalf the notice was issued, whether upon contest or consent or otherwise, and to admit his own liability to contribute or indemnify, as the case may be, to the extent claimed in the third party notice:
Provided that a person so served and failing to appear may, at any time before the disposal of the suit, apply to Court for leave to appear and the Court may grant such leave upon such terms, if any, as it may think fit to impose.
(2) Where the third party does not enter appearance in the suit and the suit is decreed upon contest or consent or otherwise against the defendant on whose behalf the notice was issued, the Court may in the said decree make such directions as to contribution or indemnity, as the case may be, against the third party and in favour of the said defendant as the circumstances of the case may require:
Provided that the execution thereof shall not issue against the third party without the leave of the Court until after satisfaction by such defendant of the decree against him.
3. If the third party desires to dispute either the claim made against him in the third party notice or the plaintiff's claim in the suit or both, he shall enter appearance in the suit on or before the date fixed therefor in the notice.
4. When the third party enters appearance under rule 3 or upon leave being granted under the proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 2, he shall apply to Court for directions as to further proceedings to be taken on the notice setting out his case or pleas in respect of the same. Notice thereof shall be given both to the defendant on whose behalf the third party notice was issued as well as to the plaintiff, fixing an early date for its hearing.
5.
(1) On the hearing of such application:
(a) if the Court is of the opinion either that the claim made in the third party notice, is prima facie not warranted or that it is not so intimately connected with the plaintiff's claim in the suit as to render its being conveniently tried along with the plaintiff's claim in the suit, or that its trial in the suit will unduly prolong or hamper the trial of the suit, the Court may dismiss the proceedings on the third party notice;
(b) if the Court is satisfied that there is a question to be tried as to the liability of the third party to make the contribution or pay the indemnity claimed, in whole or in part, and that it is just and convenient to try the same in the suit itself, the Court may order the question of such liability as between the third party and the defendant giving notice, to be tried in such manner as it may direct, and may by the said order also give liberty to the third party to defend the suit itself upon such terms as may be just.
(2) When the Court proceeds under clause (b) of sub-rule (1) it shall also give such directions as may be necessary for the delivery of pleadings, production of documents or the taking of further appropriate proceedings in the suit.
(3) If upon trial a decree comes to be passed, either on contest or consent or otherwise against the defendant on whose behalf notice was given, the Court shall in such decree make such direction as to contribution or indemnity, as the case may be, against the third party and in favour of the said defendant as the circumstances of the case may require, and also as to whether execution in respect of such direction against the third party shall or shall not be conditional upon the defendant satisfying the decree against him.
(4) The Court, while making such decrees, may decide all questions of costs as between the third party and other parties and may order any one or more to pay the costs of any other or others and give such directions as to costs as the justice of the case may require.
6.
(1) Where the Court dismisses the proceedings on a third party notice under clause (a) sub-rule (1) of rule 5, the claim made in the third party notice shall be deemed to havebeen left undecided, and the defendant on whose behalf notice was issued will be at liberty to take such other independent proceeding in respect thereof as may be open to him, as if no such notice had been issued by him.
(2) Where the Court decides to proceed under clause (b) of sub-rule (1) of rule 5, the third party shall, as from the date on which the third party notice was served on him, be a party to the suit and shall have
(a) the same rights as respects the claims made against him by or the decree passed against him in favour of the defendant on whose behalf the notice was issued, as if he had been sued in the ordinary way by the said defendant; and
(b) where he is given the liberty to defend the suit itself, the same rights as respects his defence in the suit and the decree passed therein as if he had been sued in the ordinary way by the plaintiff in the suit.
(3) On the making of an order under clause (b) of sub-rule (1) of rule 5, the cause-title of the suit shall be amended by inserting the name of the third party in the array of defendants, with the addition in brackets after his name the words "Third party on the notice of the defendants served on."-(R.O.C.

the jurisdiction of the Court, or

a bar to the suit created by any law for the time being in force, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, postpone the settlement of the other issues until after that issue has been determined, and may deal with the suit in accordance with the decision on that issue.]

4. Court may examine witnesses or documents before framing issues. -

Where the parties to a suit are agreed as to the question of fact or of law to be decided between them, they may state the same in the form of an issue, and enter into an agreement in writing that upon the finding of the Court in the affirmative or the negative of such issue,-
(a)

A copy of such notice shall, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, be served on the judgment-debtor.
63-B. (1) If the garnishee does not pay into Court the amount of the debt due from him to the judgment-debtor, and if he does not appear in answer to the notice issued under rule 63-A, or does not dispute his liability to pay such debt to the judgment-debtor, then the Court may order the garnishee to comply with the terms of such notice, and on such order execution may issue against the garnishee as though such order were a decree against him.
(2) If the garnishee appears in answer to the notice issued under rule 63-A, and disputes his liability to pay the debt attached, the Court, instead of making an order as aforesaid, may order that any issue or question necessary for determining his liability be tried as though it were an issue in a suit, and may proceed to determine such issue, and upon the determination of such issue shall pass such order upon the notice as shall be just.
63-C. Whenever in any proceedings under the foregoing rules it is alleged by the garnishee that the debt attached belongs to some third person, or that any third person has a lien or charge upon or interest in it, the Court may order such third person to appear and state the nature and particulars of his claim, if any, upon such debt, and prove the same, if necessary.
63-D. After hearing such third person and any other person who may subsequently be ordered to appear, or in the case of such third or other person not appearing as ordered, the Court may pass such order as is provided in the foregoing rules, or make such other order as the Court shall think fit, upon such terms in all cases with respect to the lien, charge or interest, if any, of such third or other person as shall seem just and reasonable.
63-E. Payment made by, or levied by execution upon the garnishee in accordance with any order made under these rules shall be a valid discharge to him as against the judgment-debtor, and any other person ordered to appear under these rules, for the amount paid or levied, although such order or the judgment may be set aside or reversed.
63-F. The costs of any application for the attachment of a debt under the foregoing rules and of any proceedings arising from or incidental to such application, shall be in the discretion of the Court. Costs awarded to the decree-holder shall, unless otherwise directed, be retained out of the money recovered by him under the garnishee order and in priority to the amount of his decree.
63-G. Out of the amount recovered under the garnishee order the Court shall deduct a sum equal to the Court-fee payable under the Indian Court-fees Act on a plaint in a suit for recovery of the money and credit the same to the Government.
63-H. (1) Where the liability of any garnishee has been tried and determined under these rules the order shall have the same force and be subject to the same conditions as to appeals or otherwise as if it were a decree.
(2) Orders not covered by clause (1) shall be appealable as orders made in execution."

*106-C. When the property which it is sought to bring to sale is immovable property within the definition of the same contained in the law for the time being in force relating to the registration of documents, the decree-holder shall file with his application for an order for sale a certificate from the Sub-Registrar within whose sub-district such proper}' is situated, showing that the Sub-Registrar has searched his Book Nos.

On the day so fixed, or on any date to which the enquiry may have been adjourned, the Court may take such evidence, by affidavit or otherwise, as it may deem necessary; and may also call for a report from the Collector of the District as to whether such land or any portion thereof is ancestral land.
After considering the evidence and the report, if any, the Court shall determine whether such land, or any, and what part of it, is ancestral land.
The result of the enquiry shall be noted in an order made for the purpose by the presiding Judge in his own handwriting.
108. When the property which it is sought to bring to sale is revenue-paying or revenue-free land or any interest in such land, and the decree is not sent to the Collector for execution under section 68, the Court, before ordering sale, shall also call upon the Collector in whose district such property is situate to report whether the property is subject to any (and, if so, to what) outstanding claims on the part of Government.

133. If the garnishee disputes his liability the Court, instead of making such order, may order that any issue or question necessary for determining his liability be tried as though it were an issue in a suit; and upon determination of such issue shall pass such order as shall be just.-(24-7-1926).

"ORDER 21-A
1. Every person applying to a Civil Court to attach movable property shall, in addition to the process-fee, deposit such reasonable sum as the Court may direct, if it thinks necessary for the cost of its removal to the Court-house, for its custody, and if such property is livestock, for its maintenance according to the rates prescribed in rule 2 of this order. If the deposit, when ordered, be not made, the attachment shall not issue. The Court may, fromtime to time, order the deposit of such further fees as may be necessary. In default of due payment the property shall be released from attachment.
2. The following daily rates shall be chargeable for the custody and maintenance of livestock under attachment:
TABLE
Explanation.-Although the rates indicated above are regarded as reasonable, the Courts should consider individual circumstances and the local conditions and permit deposit at reduced rates where the actual expenses are likely to fall short of the minima or maxima. If any specimen of special value in any of the above classes is seized, a special rate may be fixed by the Court. If any animal not specified is attached, the Court may fix the cost as a special case.
3. Where the property attached consists of agricultural implements or other articles which cannot conveniently be removed and the attaching officer does not act under the proviso to rule 43, Order 21, he may, unless the Court has otherwise directed, leave it in the village or place where it has been attached
(a) in the charge of the decree-holder or his agent or of the judgment-debtor, or some other person, provided that the decree-holder or his agent or the judgment-debtor or other person enters into a bond in Form No. 15-A of Appendix E to this Schedule, with one or more sureties, to produce the attached property when called for and to be liable for any loss which the owner of the property attached may suffer due to wilful negligence of the bounden, or
(b) in the charge of an officer of the Court, if a suitable place for its safe custody be provided and the remuneration of the officer for a period of fifteen days paid in advance.
4. If attached property (other than livestock) is not sold under the proviso to rule 43 of Order 21, or retained in the village or place where it is attached, it shall be brought to the Court-house at the decree-holder's expense and delivered to the proper officer of u, Court. In the event of the decree-holder failing to make his own arrangement for the removal of the property with safety, or paying the cost thereof in advance to the attaching officer, then, unless such payment has previously been made into Court, the attachment shall at once be deemed to be withdrawn and the property shall be made over to the person in whose possession it was before attachment.
5. When livestock is attached, it shall not, without the special order of the Court, be brought to the Court or its compound or vicinity, but shall be left at the village or place where it was attached in the manner and on the conditions set forth in rule 3 of this Order:
Provided that livestock shall not be left in the charge of any person under clause (a) of the said rule unless he enters into a bond for the proper care and maintenance thereof as well as for its production when called for, and that it shall not be left in charge of an officer of the Court under clause (b) of the said rule unless in addition to the requirements of the said clause provisions be made for its care and maintenance.
6. When for any reason, the attaching officer, shall find it impossible to obtain compliance with the requirements of the preceding rule so as to entitle him to leave the attached livestock in the village or place where it was attached and no order has been made by the Court for its removal to the Court, the attaching officer shall not proceed with the attachment and no attachment shall be deemed to have been effected.
7. Whenever it shall appear to the Court that livestock under attachment are not being properly tendered or maintained, the Court shall make such orders, as are necessary for their care and maintenance and may, if necessary, direct the attachment to cease and the livestock to be returned to the person in whose possession they were when attached. The Court may order the decree-holder to pay any expenses so incurred in providing for the care and maintenance of the livestock and may direct that any sum so paid, shall be refunded to the decree-holder by any other party to the proceedings.
8. If under a special order of the Court livestock is to be conveyed to the Court, the decree-holder shall make his own arrangement for such removal and if he fails to do so, the attachment shall be withdrawn and the property made over to the person in whose possession it was before attachment.
9. Nothing in these rules shall prevent the judgment-debtor or any person, claiming to be interested in attached livestock from making such arrangements for feeding, watering and tending the same as may not be inconsistent with its safe custody, or contrary to any order of the Court.
10. The Court may direct that any sums which have been legitimately expended by the attaching officer or are payable to him, if not duly deposited or paid, be recovered from the sale proceeds of the attached property, if sold, or be paid by the person declared entitled to delivery before he receives the same. The Court may also order that any sums deposited or paid under these rules be recovered as costs of the attachment from any party to the proceedings.
11. In the event of the custodian of attached property failing, after due notice, to produce such property at the place named to the officer deputed for the purpose, or to restore it to its owner if so ordered or failing in the case of livestock to maintain and take proper care thereof, he shall be liable to be proceeded against for the enforcement of his bond in the execution proceedings.
12. When property other than livestock is brought to the Court, it shall immediately be made over to the Nazir, who shall keep it on his sole responsibility in such place as may be approved by the Court. If the property cannot from its nature or bulk be conveniently stored, or kept on the Court premises or in the personal custody of the Nazir, he may, subject to the approval of the Court, make such arrangements for its safe custody under his own supervision may be most convenient and economical. If any premises are to be hired and persons are to be engaged for watching the property, the Court shall fix the charges for the premises and the remuneration to be allowed to the persons (not being officers of the Court) in whose custody the property is kept. All such costs shall be paid into Court by the decree-holder in advance for such period as the Court may from time to time direct.
13. When attached livestock is brought to Court under special order as aforesaid it shall be immediately made over to the Nazir, who shall be responsible for its due preservation and safe custody until he delivers it up under the orders of the Court.
14. If there be a pound maintained by Government or local authority in or near the place where the Court is held, the Nazir shall, subject to the approval of the Court, be at liberty to place in it such livestock as can be properly kept there, in which case the pound-keeper will be responsible for the property to the Nazir and shall receive from the Nazir the same rates for accommodation and maintenance thereof as are paid in respect of impounded cattle of the same description.
15. If there be no good pound available, or, if in the opinion of the Court, it b: inconvenient to lodge the attached livestock in the pound, the Nazir may keep them in his own premises or he may entrust them to any person selected by himself and approved by the Court.
16. All costs for the keeping and maintenance of the livestock shall be paid into Court by the decree-holder in advance for not less than fifteen days at a time as often as the Court may from time to time direct. In the event of failure to pay the costs within the time fixed by the Court, the attachment shall be withdrawn and the livestock shall be at the disposal of the person in whose possession it was at the time of attachment.
17. So much of any sum deposited or paid into Court under these rules as may not be expended shall be refunded to the depositor."-(3-11-1933).
