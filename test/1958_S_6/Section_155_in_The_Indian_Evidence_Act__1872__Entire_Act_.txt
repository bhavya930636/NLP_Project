Section 155 in The Indian Evidence Act, 1872
155. Impeaching credit of witness.
The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party, or, with the consent of the Court, by the party who calls him :-
(1)
by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of the witness, believe him to be unworthy of credit ;
(2)
by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has [accepted] [Substituted by Act 18 of 1872, Section 11, for "had".] the offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence ;
(3)
by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted ;
[* * *] [Sub-Clauses (4) omitted by Act 4 of 2003, Section 3 (w.e.f. 1.1.2003). Prior to its omission, sub-Clause (4) read as under:- [(4) when a man is prosecuted for rape or an attempt to ravish, it may be shown that the prosecutrix was of generally immoral character].]
Explanation. - A witness declaring another witness to be unworthy of credit may not, upon his examination-in-chief, give reasons for his belief, but he may be asked his reasons in cross-examination, and the answers which he gives cannot be contradicted, though, if they are false, he may afterwards be charged with giving false evidence.
