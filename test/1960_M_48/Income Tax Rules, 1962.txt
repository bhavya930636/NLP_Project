10B. Determination of arm's length price under section 92C .
(1)
For the purposes of sub-section (2) of section 92C, the arm's length price in relation to an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction shall be determined by any of the following methods, being the most appropriate method, in the following manner, namely :-
(a)
comparable uncontrolled price method, by which,-
(i)
the price charged or paid for property transferred or services provided in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of such transactions, is identified;
(ii)
such price is adjusted to account for differences, if any, between the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect the price in the open market;
(iii)
the adjusted price arrived at under sub-clause (ii) is taken to be an arm's length price in respect of the property transferred or services provided in the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction ;
(b)
resale price method, by which,-
(i)
the price at which property purchased or services obtained by the enterprise from an associated enterprise is resold or are provided to an unrelated enterprise, is identified;
(ii)
such resale price is reduced by the amount of a normal gross profit margin accruing to the enterprise or to an unrelated enterprise from the purchase and resale of the same or similar property or from obtaining and providing the same or similar services, in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of such transactions;
(iii)
the price so arrived at is further reduced by the expenses incurred by the enterprise in connection with the purchase of property or obtaining of services;
(iv)
the price so arrived at is adjusted to take into account the functional and other differences, including differences in accounting practices, if any, between the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect the amount of gross profit margin in the open market;
(v)
the adjusted price arrived at under sub-clause (iv) is taken to be an arm's length price in respect of the purchase of the property or obtaining of the services by the enterprise from the associated enterprise;
(c)
cost plus method, by which,-
(i)
the direct and indirect costs of production incurred by the enterprise in respect of property transferred or services provided to an associated enterprise, are determined;
(ii)
the amount of a normal gross profit mark-up to such costs (computed according to the same accounting norms) arising from the transfer or provision of the same or similar property or services by the enterprise, or by an unrelated enterprise, in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of such transactions, is determined;
(iii)
the normal gross profit mark-up referred to in sub-clause (ii) is adjusted to take into account the functional and other differences, if any, between the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect such profit mark-up in the open market;
(iv)
the costs referred to in sub-clause (i) are increased by the adjusted profit mark-up arrived at under sub-clause (iii);
(v)
the sum so arrived at is taken to be an arm's length price in relation to the supply of the property or provision of services by the enterprise;
(d)
profit split method, which may be applicable mainly in international transactions or specified domestic transactions involving transfer of unique intangibles or in multiple international transactions or specified domestic transactions which are so interrelated that they cannot be evaluated separately for the purpose of determining the arm's length price of any one transaction, by which-
(i)
the combined net profit of the associated enterprises arising from the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction in which they are engaged, is determined;
(ii)
the relative contribution made by each of the associated enterprises to the earning of such combined net profit, is then evaluated on the basis of the functions performed, assets employed or to be employed and risks assumed by each enterprise and on the basis of reliable external market data which indicates how such contribution would be evaluated by unrelated enterprises performing comparable functions in similar circumstances;
(iii)
the combined net profit is then split amongst the enterprises in proportion to their relative contributions, as evaluated under sub-clause (ii);
(iv)
the profit thus apportioned to the assessee is taken into account to arrive at an arm's length price in relation to the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction :
Provided that the combined net profit referred to in sub-clause (i) may, in the first instance, be partially allocated to each enterprise so as to provide it with a basic return appropriate for the type of international transaction or specified domestic transaction in which it is engaged, with reference to market returns achieved for similar types of transactions by independent enterprises, and thereafter, the residual net profit remaining after such allocation may be split amongst the enterprises in proportion to their relative contribution in the manner specified under sub-clauses (ii) and (iii), and in such a case the aggregate of the net profit allocated to the enterprise in the first instance together with the residual net profit apportioned to that enterprise on the basis of its relative contribution shall be taken to be the net profit arising to that enterprise from the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction ;
(e)
transactional net margin method, by which,-
(i)
the net profit margin realised by the enterprise from an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction entered into with an associated enterprise is computed in relation to costs incurred or sales effected or assets employed or to be employed by the enterprise or having regard to any other relevant base;
(ii)
the net profit margin realised by the enterprise or by an unrelated enterprise from a comparable uncontrolled transaction or a number of such transactions is computed having regard to the same base;
(iii)
the net profit margin referred to in sub-clause (ii) arising in comparable uncontrolled transactions is adjusted to take into account the differences, if any, between the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect the amount of net profit margin in the open market;
(iv)
the net profit margin realised by the enterprise and referred to in sub-clause (i) is established to be the same as the net profit margin referred to in sub-clause (iii);
(v)
the net profit margin thus established is then taken into account to arrive at an arm's length price in relation to the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction;
(f)
any other method as provided in rule 10AB.
(2)
For the purposes of sub-rule (1), the comparability of an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction with an uncontrolled transaction shall be judged with reference to the following, namely:-
(a)
the specific characteristics of the property transferred or services provided in either transaction;
(b)
the functions performed, taking into account assets employed or to be employed and the risks assumed, by the respective parties to the transactions;
(c)
the contractual terms (whether or not such terms are formal or in writing) of the transactions which lay down explicitly or implicitly how the responsibilities, risks and benefits are to be divided between the respective parties to the transactions;
(d)
conditions prevailing in the markets in which the respective parties to the transactions operate, including the geographical location and size of the markets, the laws and Government orders in force, costs of labour and capital in the markets, overall economic development and level of competition and whether the markets are wholesale or retail.
(3)
An uncontrolled transaction shall be comparable to an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction if-
(i)
none of the differences, if any, between the transactions being compared, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions are likely to materially affect the price or cost charged or paid in, or the profit arising from, such transactions in the open market; or
(ii)
reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the material effects of such differences.
(4)
The data to be used in analysing the comparability of an uncontrolled transaction with an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction shall be the data relating to the financial year (hereafter in this rule and in rule 10CA referred to as the 'current year') in which the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction has been entered into :
Provided that data relating to a period not being more than two years prior to the current year may also be considered if such data reveals facts which could have an influence on the determination of transfer prices in relation to the transactions being compared:
Provided further that the first proviso shall not apply while analysing the comparability of an uncontrolled transaction with an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction, entered into on or after the 1st day of April, 2014.
(5)
In a case where the most appropriate method for determination of the arm's length price of an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction, entered into on or after the 1st day of April, 2014, is the method specified in clause (b), clause (c) or clause (e) of sub-section (1) of section 92C, then, notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule (4), the data to be used for analysing the comparability of an uncontrolled transaction with an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction shall be,-
(i)
the data relating to the current year; or
(ii)
the data relating to the financial year immediately preceding the current, if the data relating to the current year is not available at the time of furnishing the return of income by the assessee, for the assessment year relevant to the current year:
Provided that where the data relating to the current year is subsequently available at the time of determination of arm's length price of an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction during the course of any assessment proceeding for the assessment year relevant to the current year, then, such data shall be used for such determination irrespective of the fact that the data was not available at the time of furnishing the return of income of the relevant assessment year.
10C. Most appropriate method.
(1)
For the purposes of sub-section (1) of section 92C, the most appropriate method shall be the method which is best suited to the facts and circumstances of each particular international transaction or specified domestic transaction, and which provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length price in relation to the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction, as the case may be.
(2)
In selecting the most appropriate method as specified in sub-rule (1), the following factors shall be taken into account, namely:-
(a)
the nature and class of the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction;
(b)
the class or classes of associated enterprises entering into the transaction and the functions performed by them taking into account assets employed or to be employed and risks assumed by such enterprises;
(c)
the availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for application of the method;
(d)
the degree of comparability existing between the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction and the uncontrolled transaction and between the enterprises entering into such transactions;
(e)
the extent to which reliable and accurate adjustments can be made to account for differences, if any, between the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transaction or between the enterprises entering into such transactions;
(f)
the nature, extent and reliability of assumptions required to be made in application of a method.
10CA. Computation of arm's length price in certain cases.
(1)
Where in respect of an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction, the application of the most appropriate method referred to in sub-section (1) of section 92C results in determination of more than one price, then the arm's length price in respect of such international transaction or specified domestic transaction shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of this rule.
(2)
A data set shall be constructed by placing the prices referred to in sub-rule (1) in an ascending order and the arm's length price shall be determined on the basis of the dataset so constructed:
Provided that in a case referred to in clause (i) of sub-rule (5) of rule 10B, where the comparable uncontrolled transaction has been identified on the basis of data relating to the current year and the enterprise undertaking the said uncontrolled transaction, not being the enterprise undertaking the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction referred to in sub-rule (1), has in either or both of the two financial years immediately preceding the current year undertaken the same or similar comparable uncontrolled transaction then,-
(i)
the most appropriate method used to determine the price of the comparable uncontrolled transaction or transactions undertaken in the aforesaid period and the price in respect of such uncontrolled transactions shall be determined; and
(ii)
the weighted average of the prices, computed in accordance with the manner provided in sub-rule (3), of the comparable uncontrolled transactions undertaken in the current year and in the aforesaid period preceding it shall be included in the dataset instead of the price referred to in sub-rule (1):
Provided further that in a case referred to in clause (ii) of sub-rule (5) of rule 10B, where the comparable uncontrolled transaction has been identified on the basis of the data relating to the financial year immediately preceding the current year and the enterprise undertaking the said uncontrolled transaction, not being the enterprise undertaking the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction referred to in sub-rule (1), has in the financial year immediately preceding the said financial year undertaken the same or similar comparable uncontrolled transaction then,-
(i)
the price in respect of such uncontrolled transaction shall be determined by applying the most appropriate method in a similar manner as it was applied to determine the price of the comparable uncontrolled transaction undertaken in the financial year immediately preceding the current year; and
(ii)
the weighted average of the prices, computed in accordance with the manner provided in sub-rule (3), of the comparable uncontrolled transactions undertaken in the aforesaid period of two years shall be included in the dataset instead of the price referred to in sub-rule (1) :
Provided also that where the use of data relating to the current year in terms of the proviso to sub-rule (5) of rule 10B establishes that,-
(i)
the enterprise has not undertaken same or similar uncontrolled transaction during the current year; or
(ii)
the uncontrolled transaction undertaken by an enterprise in the current year is not a comparable uncontrolled transaction,
then, irrespective of the fact that such an enterprise had undertaken comparable uncontrolled transaction in the financial year immediately preceding the current year or the financial year immediately preceding such financial year, the price of comparable uncontrolled transaction or the weighted average of the prices of the uncontrolled transactions, as the case may be, undertaken by such enterprise shall not be included in the dataset.
(3)
Where an enterprise has undertaken comparable uncontrolled transactions in more than one financial year, then for the purposes of sub-rule (2) the weighted average of the prices of such transactions shall be computed in the following manner, namely:-
(i)
where the prices have been determined using the method referred to in clause (b) of sub-rule (1) of rule 10B, the weighted average of the prices shall be computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of sales which has been considered for arriving at the respective prices;
(ii)
where the prices have been determined using the method referred to in clause (c) of sub-rule (1) of rule 10B, the weighted average of the prices shall be computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of costs which has been considered for arriving at the respective prices;
(iii)
where the prices have been determined using the method referred to in clause (e) of sub- rule (1) of rule 10B, the weighted average of the prices shall be computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of costs incurred or sales effected or assets employed or to be employed, or as the case may be, any other base which has been considered for arriving at the respective prices.
(4)
Where the most appropriate method applied is a method other than the method referred to in clause (d) or clause (f) of sub-section (1) of section 92C and the dataset constructed in accordance with sub-rule (2) consists of six or more entries, an arm's length range beginning from the thirty-fifth percentile of the dataset and ending on the sixty-fifth percentile of the dataset shall be constructed and the arm's length price shall be computed in accordance with sub-rule (5) and sub-rule (6).
(5)
If the price at which the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken is within the range referred to in sub-rule (4), then, the price at which such international transaction or the specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken shall be deemed to be the arm's length price.
(6)
If the price at which the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken is outside the arm's length range referred to in sub-rule (4), the arm's length price shall be taken to be the median of the dataset.
(7)
In a case where the provisions of sub-rule (4) are not applicable, the arm's length price shall be the arithmetical mean of all the values included in the dataset:
Provided that, if the variation between the arm's length price so determined and price at which the international transaction or specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken does not exceed such percentage not exceeding three per cent of the latter, as may be notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette in this behalf, the price at which the international transaction or specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken shall be deemed to be the arm's length price.
(8)
For the purposes of this rule,-
(a)
"the thirty-fifth percentile" of a dataset, having values arranged in an ascending order, shall be the lowest value in the dataset such that at least thirty five per cent of the values included in the dataset are equal to or less than such value:
Provided that, if the number of values that are equal to or less than the aforesaid value is a whole number, then the thirty-fifth percentile shall be the arithmetic mean of such value and the value immediately succeeding it in the dataset;
(b)
"the sixty-fifth percentile" of a dataset, having values arranged in an ascending order, shall be the lowest value in the dataset such that at least sixty five per cent of the values included in the dataset are equal to or less than such value:
Provided that, if the number of values that are equal to or less than the aforesaid value is a whole number, then the sixty-fifth percentile shall be the arithmetic mean of such value and the value immediately succeeding it in the dataset;
(c)
"the median" of the dataset, having values arranged in an ascending order, shall be the lowest value in the dataset such that at least fifty per cent of the values included in the dataset are equal to or less than such value:
Provided that, if the number of values that are equal to or less than the aforesaid value is a whole number, then the median shall be the arithmetic mean of such value and the value immediately succeeding it in the dataset.
Illustration 1. - The data for the current year of the comparable uncontrolled transactions or the entities undertaking such transactions is available at the time of furnishing return of income by the assessee and based on the same, seven enterprises have been identified to have undertaken the comparable uncontrolled transaction in the current year. All the identified comparable enterprises have also undertaken comparable uncontrolled transactions in a period of two years preceding the current year. The Profit level Indicator (PLI) used in applying the most appropriate method is operating profit as compared to operating cost (OP/OC). The weighted average shall be based upon the weight of OC as computed below :

For construction of the arm's length range the data place of thirty-fifth and sixty-fifth percentile shall be computed in the following manner, namely:
Total no. of data points in dataset *(35/100)
Total no. of data points in dataset *(65/100)
Thus, the data place of the thirty-fifth percentile = 7*0.35=2.45.
Since this is not a whole number, the next higher data place, i.e. the value at the third place would have at least thirty five per cent of the values below it. The thirty-fifth percentile is therefore value at the third place, i.e. 8.2%.
The data place of the sixty-fifth percentile is = 7*0.65=4.55.
Since this is not a whole number, the next higher data place, i.e. the value at the fifth place would have at least sixty five per cent of the values below it. The sixty-fifth percentile is therefore value at fifth place, i.e. 10.57%.
The arm's length range will be beginning at 8.2% and ending at 10.57%.
Therefore, if the transaction price of the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction has OP/OC percentage which is equal to or more than 8.2% and less than or equal to 10.57%, it is within the range. The transaction price in such cases will be deemed to be the arm's length price and no adjustment shall be required. However, if the transaction price is outside the arm's length range, say 6.2%, then for the purpose of determining the arm's length price the median of the dataset shall be first determined in the following manner:
The data place of median is calculated by first computing the total number of data point in the dataset * (50/100). In this case it is 7*0.5=3.5.
Since this is not a whole number, the next higher data place, i.e. the value at the fourth place would have at least fifty per cent of the values below it (median).
The median is the value at fourth place, i.e., 9%. Therefore, the arm's length price shall be considered as 9% and adjustment shall accordingly be made.

Applying the formula given in the Illustration 1, the data place of the thirty-fifth and sixty-fifty percentile is determined as follows:
Thirty-fifth percentile place = 20* (35/100) = 7.
Sixty-fifth percentile place = 20* (65/100) = 13.
Since the thirty-fifth percentile place is a whole number, it shall be the average of the prices at the seventh and next higher, i.e.; eighth place. This is (47+48)/2 = Rs.47,500.
Similarly, the sixty-fifth percentile will be average of thirteenth and fourteenth place prices. This is (48.5+49)/2=Rs.48,750
The median of the range (the fiftieth percentile place) = 20*(50/100)=10
Since the fiftieth percentile place is a whole number, it shall be the average of the prices at the tenth and next higher, i.e.; eleventh place. This is (48.35+48.45)/2= Rs.48,400.
Thus, the arm's length range in this case shall be from Rs.47,500 to Rs.48,750.
Consequently, any transaction price which is equal to or more than Rs.47,500 but less than or equal to Rs.48,750 shall be considered to be within the arm's length range.
