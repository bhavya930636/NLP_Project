The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
(14 of 1947)
Last Updated 12th January, 2022 [13/619]
Statement of Object and Reasons. - Experience of the working of the Trade Disputes Act, 1929, has revealed that its main defect is that while restraints have been imposed on the rights of strike and lock-out in public utility services, no provision has been made to render the proceedings institutable under the Act for the settlement of an industrial dispute, either by reference to a Board of Conciliation or to a Court of Inquiry, conclusive and binding on the parties to the dispute. This defect was overcome during the war by empowering under rule 81-A of the Defence of India Rules, the Central Government to refer industrial disputes to adjudicators and to enforce their awards. Rule 81-A, which was to lapse on the 1st October, 1946, is being kept in force by the Emergency Powers (Continuance) Ordinance, 1946, for a further period of six months; and as industrial unrest, in checking which this rule has proved useful, is gaining momentum due to the stress of post-war industrial re-adjustment, the need of permanent legislation in replacement of this rule, is self-evident. This Bill embodies the essential principles of rule 81-A, which have proved generally acceptable to both employers and workmen, retaining intact, for the most part, the provisions of the Trade Disputes Act, 1929.
The two institutions for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes provided for in the Bill are the Works Committees consisting of representatives of employers and workmen, and Industrial Tribunals consisting of one or more members possessing qualifications, ordinarily required for appointment as Judges of a High Court. Power has been given to appropriate Government to require Works Committees to be constituted in every industrial establishment employing 100 workmen, or more and their duties will be to remove causes of friction between the employer and workmen in the day-to-day working of the establishment and to promote measures for securing amity and good relations between them. Industrial peace will be most enduring where it is founded on voluntary settlement, and it is hoped that the Works Committees will render recourse to the remaining machinery . provided for in the Bill for the settlement of disputes infrequent. A reference to an Industrial Tribunal will lie where both parties to any industrial dispute apply for such reference, and also where the appropriate Government considers it expedient so to do. An award of a Tribunal may be enforced either wholly or in part by the appropriate Government for a period not exceeding one year. The power to refer disputes to Industrial Tribunals and enforce their awards is an essential corollary to the obligation that lies on the Government to secure conclusive determination of the disputes with a view to redressing the legitimate grievances of the parties thereto, such obligation arising from the imposition of restraints on the rights of strike and lock-out, which must remain inviolate, except where consideration of public interest override such rights.
The Bill also seeks to re-orient the administration of the conciliation machinery provided in the Trade Disputes Act. Conciliation will be compulsory in all disputes in public utility services and optional in the case of other industrial establishments. With a view to expedite conciliation proceedings time limits have been prescribed for conclusion thereof-14 days in the case of conciliation officer and 2 months in the case of Board of Conciliation, from the date of notice of strike. A settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceedings will be binding for such periods as may be agreed upon by the parties and where no period has been agreed upon, for a period of one year, and will continue to be binding until revoked by a 3 months' notice by either party to the dispute.
Another important new feature of the Bill relates to the prohibition of strikes and lock-outs during the pendency of conciliation and adjudication proceedings of settlements reached in the course of conciliation proceedings and of awards of Industrial Tribunals declared binding by the appropriate Government. The underlying argument is that where a dispute has been referred to conciliation for adjudication, a strike or lock-out in furtherance thereof, is both unnecessary and inexpedient. Where on the date of reference to conciliation or adjudication, a strike or lock-out is already in existence, power is given to the appropriate Government to prohibit its continuance lest the chances of settlement or speedy determination of the dispute should be jeopardized.
The Bill also empowers the appropriate Government to declare, if public interest or emergency so requires, by notification in the Official Gazette, any industry to be a public utility service, for such period, if any, as may be specified in the notification.
Amendment Act 41 of 1956-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - Doubt has been raised whether retrenchment compensation under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, becomes payable by reason merely of the fact that there has been a change of employers, even if the service of the workman is continued without interruption and the terms and conditions of his service remain unaltered. This has created difficulty in the transfer, reconstitution and amalgamation of companies and it is proposed to make the intention clear by amending section 25-F of the Act.
2. Questions have also been raised whether a workman who is laid-off for more than forty-five days continuously is entitled to lay-off compensation for any period beyond the first forty-five days. Opportunity has been taken to remove the ambiguity by specifying the circumstances under which such compensation beyond the first forty-five days would be admissible to a workman.
Amendment Act 36 of 1964-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The Bill seeks to make changes in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The important changes in the Act were discussed at various tripartite meetings like the Indian Labour Conference and the Standing Labour Committee and have their approval.
2. Section 7-A of the Act lays down the qualification for appointment as the Presiding Officer of a Tribunal. The State Government have been experiencing difficulty in getting suitable persons for appointment as Presiding Officers of Tribunals. Many of the State Governments have accordingly amended this section in its application to their States enabling District and Sessions Judges to be appointed to these posts. It is now proposed to provide for the appointment of a serving or a retired District Judge or Additional District Judge of not less than three years' standing as a Presiding Office of the Tribunal.
3. In order to encourage arbitration, it is proposed to provide (1) for the appointment of umpires in case of difference of opinion between an even number of arbitrators, (2) for p3ohibition of strikes and lock-outs during arbitration proceedings, and (3) for application of section 33 during the pendency of any arbitration proceedings. Further, an arbitration award is binding at present only on the parties to the arbitration. This position is discouraging employers from agreeing readily to voluntary arbitration as they cannot enforce it on the workers who are not a party to the agreement. It is now being provided in the Bill that the arbitration award shall have the same binding force as an award of a Tribunal provided that the appropriate Government is satisfied that the parties to the agreement represent the majority of each party
.4. The Supreme Court have held that a notice to terminate an award can be given by a group of workmen acting collectively either through their Union or otherwise, and it is not necessary that such a group or the Union should represent the majority of the workmen bound by the award. In order to prevent any irresponsible or dissatisfied group of workmen from terminating the settlement or an award without any regard for the effect of such termination on the entire body of the workmen, it is proposed to amend the Act so that in future only a majority of workmen shall have the right to terminate a settlement or award.
5. Opportunity has been availed of to propose a few other essential amendments which are mainly of a formal or clarificatory nature.
Amendment Act 35 of 1965-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - In order to simplify the existing procedure for handling disputes in respect of the Air Corporations, it is considered necessary to bring the Indian Airlines and Air India Corporations within the jurisdiction of the Central sphere as in the case of some other Corporations of all India importance such as the Agricultural Refinance Corporation, the Deposit Insurance Corporation, etc.
2. In construing the scope of industrial dispute, Courts have taken the view that a dispute between an employer and an individual workman cannot per se be an industrial dispute, but it may become one if it is taken up by a Union or a number of workmen making a common cause with the aggrieved individual workman. In view of this, cases of individual dismissals and discharges cannot be taken up for conciliation or arbitration or referred to adjudication under the Industrial Disputes Act, unless they are sponsored by a Union or a number of workmen. Iris now proposed to make the machinery under the Act available in such cases.
3. Section 25-C of the Act provides that a workman (who has completed not less than one year of continuous service) on being laid-off, is entitled to receive compensation up to a maximum period of forty-five days during the course of any twelve months. Where, however, the period of lay-off after the expiry of the first forty-five days comprises continuous periods of one week or more, the workman is to be paid compensation for all the days comprised in every such subsequent period of lay-off, unless there is an agreement to the contrary between the workman and the employer. This provision is open to abuse inasmuch as workmen could be denied lay-off compensation by being made to work for some days in each week after the first forty-five days of lay-off. With a view to prevent such an abuse, it is now considered necessary to make a provision that lay-off compensation would become payable for all the days of lay-off beyond the first forty-five days, whether the period is continuous for a week or not
4. Section 29 of the Act provides for the imposition of a penalty for breach of a settlement or an award, which may be imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or fine, or both. There is no provision for enhanced penalty in the event of continued breach of settlements or awards with the result that some unscrupulous employers are able to successfully thwart the implementation of settlements or awards by paying a fine once, which may be far less than what the obligation would otherwise entail. Consequently, the workmen are unable to get the benefits flowing from the award though the employer might have been convicted for the breach. Thus, the absence of provisions for deterrent penalties for continued breach of settlements and awards is acting as an impediment in the way.of implementation of settlements and awards, and it is, therefore, now proposed to make a suitable provision for the imposition of punishment in case of a continuing breach of a settlement or an award after conviction for the first breach.
5. Many of the above proposals have also received the approval of the Standing Labour Committee at its twenty-first session.
6. The present Bill seeks to amend the Industrial Disputes Act to give effect to the above proposals and opportunity has also been availed of to make two other amendments of procedural nature.
AmendnlentAct45 of 1971-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - In Indian Iron and Steel Company Limited v. Their Workmen (A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 130 at 138), the Supreme Court, while considering the Tribunal's power to interfere with the management's decision co dismiss, discharge or terminate the services of a workman, has observed that in cases of dismissal on misconduct, the Tribunal does not act as a Court of appeal and substitute its own judgment for that of the management and that the Tribunal will interfere only when there is want of good faith, victimisation, unfair labour practice, etc., on the part of the management.
2. The International Labour Organisation, in its recommendation (No. 119) concerning "Termination of employment at the initiative of the employer" adopted in June, 1963, has recommended that a worker aggrieved by the termination of his employment should be entitled to appeal against the termination, among others, to a neutral body such as an arbitrator, a Court, an arbitration committee or a similar body and that the neutral body concerned should be empowered to examine the reasons given in the termination of employment and the other circumstances relating to the case and to render a decision on the justification of the termination. The International Labour Organisation has further recommended that the neutral body should be empowered (if it finds that the termination of employment was unjustified) to order that the worker concerned, unless reinstated with unpaid wages, should be paid adequate compensation or afforded some other relief.
3. In accordance with these recommendations, it is considered that the Tribunal's power in an adjudication proceeding relating to discharge or dismissal of a workman should not be limited and that the Tribunal should have the power, in cases wherever necessary, to set aside the order of discharge or dismissal and direct reinstatement of the workman on such terms and conditions, if any, as it thinks fit or give such other relief to the workman including the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of discharge or dismissal as the circumstances of the case may require. For this purpose, a new section 11-A is proposed to be inserted in the Industrial Disputes Act,1947.
4. Section 25-FFF of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, provides for payment of compensation to workmen in case of closing down of an undertaking and the amount is calculated at the rate of fifteen days' average pay for every completed year of continuous service or any part thereof in excess of six months But, in the case of closure on account of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the employer, the ceiling limit of compensation is the average pay for three months. A Central Workers' Organisation suggested an amendment of section 25-FFF of the Act to remove the ceiling limit of compensation in case of closure of a mining undertaking by reason of exhaustion of its reserves. According to its suggestion such closing down should not be deemed to be on account of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the employers because the employers have definite knowledge of the exhaustion of the area-reserves of mines. The Industrial Committee on Coal Mining, in its ninth session (Calcutta 10th, 11th August, 1964) and the Industrial Committee on Mines other than Coal in its fourth session (New Delhi 20th, 21st February, 1965) have agreed to the suggestion to amend the Act for the aforesaid purpose. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend section 25-FFF to provide for payment of full compensation to workmen in the event of closing down of a mining undertaking due to exhaustion of its reserves subject to the condition that no retrenchment compensation would be payable to the workmen concerned when an employer provides them with alternative employment with effect from the date of closure at the same remuneration as they were entitled to receive, and on the same terms and conditions of service as were applicable to them, immediately before the closure.
5. It is also proposed to make the Central Government as the appropriate Government inrelation to the industrial disputes concerning the Industrial Finance Corporation and the Life Insurance Corporation of India. It is also proposed to declare service in, or in connection with, the working of major ports and docks as permanent public utility service.
Amendment Act 32 of 1972-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The problem of closure of industrial undertakings resulting in loss of production and unemployment of large numbers of workmen has of late become very serious. Employers have declared sudden closures of industrial establishments without any notice or advance intimation to the Government. Several factors appear to have led to these closures, amongst which are accumulated losses over a number of years and mismanagement of the affairs of the establishments. The unsatisfactory state of industrial relations (in the sense of labour unrest making it difficult to sustain regular production) has been pleaded as a precipitating factor. Certain other causes like financial difficulties and non-availability of essential raw materials have also been mentioned.
2. Since the problem of closure has been acute in the State of West Bengal, a President's Act-the Industrial Disputes (West Bengal Amendment) Act, 1971-was enacted on the 28th August, 1971. This provided that an employer who intended to close down and undertaking should serve at least sixty days' notice on the State Government stating clearly the reasons for the intended closure of the undertaking. While enacting this legislation for West Bengal, Government considered it desirable to promote Central legislation on the subject, since the problem of closure was not limited to West Bengal but was found in varying degrees in other States as well.
3. It was, however, felt that before Central legislation was enacted, the matter should be considered by the Indian Labour Conference. The Indian Labour Conference which met on the 22nd and 23rd October, 1971 generally endorsed the proposal for Central legislation.
4. The Bill seeks to give effect to the recommendation of the Indian Labour Conference. It provides for the service of a notice, at least sixty days before the intended closure of an undertaking is to become effective, so that within this period prompt remedial measures could be taken, where the circumstances permit to prevent such closure. No notice will be required to be served in the case of undertakings set up for construction of buildings, roads, canals, dams and other construction works and projects or in the case of small establishments employing less than fifty-persons. The Bill also provides for penalty for closing down any undertaking without serving the requisite notice.
Amendment Act 32 of 1976-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 does not contain any provision for preventing lay-off and retrenchment. Though the Act provides for sixty days' notice by the employer prior to closing down an establishment employing fifty or more persons, it does not provide for any prior scrutiny of the reasons for such closure. The employers have an unfettered right to close down an establishment, subject to the provision of sixty day's notice.
2. There have been many cases of large scale lay-offs, particular by large companies and undertakings. Cases of large-scale retrenchment as well as closures have also been reported time and again. This action on the part of the management has resulted in all-round demoralising effect on the workmen. In order to prevent avoidable hardship to the employees and to maintain higher tempo of production and productivity, it has become now necessary to put some reasonable restrictions on the employer's right to lay-off retrenchment, and closure. This need has also been felt by different State Governments.
3. This Bill, therefore, seeks to amend the Industrial Disputes Act to make prior approval of the appropriate Government necessary in the case of lay-off, retrenchment and closure in industrial establishments where 300 or more workmen are employed. This is sought to be achieved by inserting a new Chapter V-B in the Act. In the interests of rehabilitation of workmen and for maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community, there is a provision in the Bill for restarting the undertakings which were already closed down otherwise than on account of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the employer.
4. It is also proposed to provide for more stringent penalties for the contravention of theprovisions of Chapter V-B. For the purposes of this Chapter, it is also proposed to make the Central Government the appropriate Government in respect of companies in which not less than fifty-one per cent of the paid-up share capital is held by the Central Government and of Corporations established by or under any law made by Parliament.
Amendment Act 46 of I982-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, provides the machinery and procedure for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes. The provisions of the Act had been amended from time to time in the light of experience gained in its actual working, case laws and industrial relations policy of the Government. The National Commission on Labour (1969) which made an in-depth study of the industrial relations and procedures had identified a number of areas in which the Act needed to be amended to promote industrial harmony. The recommendations of the National Commission on Labour were discussed at various forums.
2. The objectives of the Bill are mainly to ensure speedier resolution of industrial disputes by removing procedural delays and to make certain other amendments in the light of some of the recommendations of the National Commission on Labour. The Bill seeks to make the following amendments in the Act, namely:
(i) Difficulties have arisen in the interpretation of the definition of the expression "appropriate Government" as contained in the Act in respect of certain industrial establishments. It is proposed to remove these difficulties by making the Central Government the appropriate Government in respect of those establishments.
(ii) The Supreme Court in its decision in the Bangalore Wafer Supply and Sewerage Board v. A. Rajappa A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 548: (1978) 2 S.C.C. 213, had, while interpreting the definition of "industry" as contained in the Act, observed that Government might restructure this definition by suitable legislative measures. It is accordingly proposed to redefine the term "industry". While doing so, it is proposed to exclude from the scope of this expression, certain institutions like hospitals and dispensaries, educational, scientific research or training institutes, institutions engaged in charitable, social and philanthropic services, etc., in view of the need to maintain in such institutions an atmosphere different from that in industrial and commercial undertakings and to meet the special needs of such organisations. It is also proposed to exclude sovereign functions of Government including activities relating to atomic energy, space and defence research from the purview of the term "industry". However, keeping in view the special characteristics of these activities and the fact that their workmen also need protection, it is proposed to have a separate law for the settlement of individual grievances as well as collective disputes in respect of the workmen of these institutions. All these have been taken into account and the term "industry" has been made more specific while making the coverage wider. The scope of the term "workman" has been enlarged to cover the supervisory staff whose wages do not exceed Rs. 1,600 per month.
(iii) A model grievances redressal procedure had been commended for adoption. But this voluntary arrangement has not proved effective. It is, therefore, proposed to make it obligatory for every industrial establishment employing 100 or more workmen to set up a time bound grievance redressal procedure.
(iv) There has been dissatisfaction with delays involved in the adjudication of industrial disputes. It is proposed to fix a time-limit for the adjudication of individual and collective disputes, as also for the disposal of claims, applications and other references by the Labour Court, the Industrial Tribunal or the National Industrial Tribunal with a view to securing speedier justice to workmen. It has also been provided that no case will lapse merely on account of the fact that the time limits specified had expired.
(v) There have been conflicting decisions about the right of legal heirs of a workman in the event of the death of the latter pending proceedings before the authorities under the Act. Provision is being made to make it clear that pending disputes will not abate in the event of the death of the workman.
(vi) It is observed that when Labour Courts pass awards of reinstatement, these are often contested by an employer in Supreme Court and High Courts. The delay in the implementation of the award causes hardship to the workmen concerned. It is, therefore, proposed to provide for payment of wages last drawn by the workmen concerned, under certain conditions, from the date of the award till the case is finally decided in the Supreme Court or the High Courts.
(vii) It is proposed to provide that workmen in mines could be laid-off for reasons of fire, flood, excess of inflammable gas or explosion without previous permission.
(viii) Taking into consideration the observations of the Supreme Court in the Excel Wear case, A.I.R. 1979 S.C. 25: (1978) 4 S.C.C. 224, it is proposed to recast the provisions relating to closure of industrial establishments as contained in the Act to provide for the following, namely:
(a) The employer will have to apply to Government to obtain permission for closure ninety days before the intended date of closure and a copy of such application will have to be served by him on the representatives of the workmen also;
(b) On receipt of such application, Government. after giving a reasonable opportunity of being ;heard to the applicant and the representatives of the workmen, and after taking into consideration the guidelines laid down in the provision, may grant or refuse to grant the permission asked for. Permission shall be deemed to have been granted if no order of the Government granting or refusing to grant permission is communicated within the specified period;
(c) The order of the Government granting or refusing to grant permission is being made final subject to a review by the Government or a reference to the Industrial Tribunal;
(d) Where an undertaking is permitted to be closed down, the workmen shall be entitled to closure compensation equivalent to fifteen days average pay for every completed year of continuous service or part thereof in excess of six months.
(ix) The special provisions relating to lay-off, retrenchment and closure as contained in Chapter V-B of the Act apply at present to establishments, employing 300 workmen or above. With a view to extending this statutory protection to workmen of smaller establishments also, it is proposed to reduce the existing employment limit from 300 to 100.
(x) There is at present no Central law specifying unfair labour practices on the part of employers, workmen and the Trade Unions of employers and workmen and for imposing any penalty for resorting to such undesirable practices. Certain State laws as well as Voluntary Codes of Discipline laid down by the Indian Labour Conference specify certain practices as unfair labour practices. The National Commission on Labour which examined this aspect in detail suggested a list of such unfair practices. It is proposed to make suitable provision in the Act to specify certain practices as unfair labour practices on the part of employers, workmen and Trade Unions and to provide for penalties for those indulging in such practices.
3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects and to provide for certain other consequential and clarificatory changes in the Act.
Amendment Act 49 of 1984-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, provides the machinery and procedure for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes. The provisions of the Act had been amended from time to time in the light of experience gained in its actual workings, case laws and industrial relations policy of the Government.
2. The amendments proposed in the Bill are mainly to clarify certain doubts expressed by Courts on the validity of certain provisions of the Act. The Bill, inter alto, seeks to make the following amendments in the Act, namely:
(i) Difficulties have arisen in the interpretation of the expression "retrenchment". It is proposed to exclude from the definition of "retrenchment" as contained in the Act termination of the service of a workman as a result of the non-renewal of the contract of employment on its expiry and of the termination of such contract in accordance with the provisions thereof;
(ii) Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the Excel Wear case, A.I.R. 1479 S.C. 25: (1978) 4 S.C.C. 224, some High Courts have declared invalid the special provisions relating to lay-off and retrenchment contained in the Act which applied to establishments employing 300 or more workmen. It is proposed to redraft these provisions on the same lines as the amended provision relating to closure, which was inserted by the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1982 (46 of 1982), after taking into consideration the observations of the Supreme Court in the above case.
3. The Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1982, was passed by Parliament in August, 1982. A number of provisions of that Act confer considerable benefits to workmen. In order to provide that the various sections of that Act can be notified for enforcement separately and with effect from different dates, it is proposed to amend suitably section 1(2) of that Act.
Amendment Act 24 of 1996-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, Inter alia, provides for the machinery and procedure for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes. Clause (a) of section 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, defines the term appropriate Government. "Sub-clause (i) of clause (a) stipulates the Central Government as the appropriate Government" in relation to any industrial dispute concerning any industry or activity specially mentioned therein, whereas sub-clause (ii) of that clause designates the State Government as the "appropriate Government" in relation to all other industrial disputes. According to this scheme, the Central Government was the appropriate Government in relation to any industrial dispute concerning the Indian Airlines and Air India Corporation, the Industrial Finance Corporation of India, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission or the International Airports Authority of India. With the enactment of the Air Corporations (Transfer of Undertakings and Repeal) Act, 1994 the Industrial Finance Corporation (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act, 1993, and the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act, 1993, the Central Government ceased to be the "appropriate Government" in respect of these establishments. Further with the enactment of the Airports Authority of India Act, 1994, the National Airports Authority of India and the International Airports Authority of India were merged into one single entity named the Airports Authority of India. Meanwhile, a number of private airline companies got incorporated and commenced their operations over Indian skies. For all airline companies and the newly constituted Airports Authority of India, the concerned State Government is the "appropriate Government".
2. As the establishments and activities, related to air transport services, the Airports Authority of India, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited and the Industrial Finance Corporation of India Limited, are spread across States and have nation-wide ramifications, it was considered expedient and desirable to ensure uniformity in the handling of industrial disputes concerning such establishments/activities. A significant number of industrial disputes concerning employees of the Air India Limited, the Indian Airlines Limited, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited and the Industrial Finance Corporation of India Limited were pending for settlement through conciliation, arbitration or adjudication for want of competent jurisdiction and hence conclusive resolution of the question of "appropriate Government" for these organisations had acquired an urgency that could brook no further delay without adversely affecting harmonious industrial relations.
3. As Parliament was not in session, the President promulgated the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Ordinance, 1995 (Ordinance 12 of 1995) on the 11th day of October, 1995 to stipulate the Central Government as the "appropriate Government" in respect of
(i) any air transport service (including Air India Limited and Indian Airlines Limited as well as private, domestic and international air transport services);
(ii) Airports Authority of India;
(iii) Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited; and
(iv) Industrial Finance Corporation of India Limited, by amending sub-clause (i) of clause (a) of section 2
4. The Bill seeks to replace the above Ordinance.

COMMENTS
The words "discharge" and "dismissal" as employed by the legislature in Item I of Sch. IV covered different types of situations and circumstances under which they are passed. It is, therefore, not possible to agree with the submission that unless the respondent shows that he was discharged by way of penalty, he cannot invoke any of the clauses of item I of Sch. IV : Lokmat Newspapers (P.) Ltd. v. Shanknrprasad, A.I.R. 1999 S.C. 2423 : (1999) 6 S.C.C. 275.
An employee who makes a grievance against an order of discharge or dismissal passed against him can invoke any of the listed Cls. (a) to (g) of Item I of Sch. IV. First it should be alleged by the complainant employee that he was discharged or dismissed from service by the employer and then he has to further show whether such an order attracted any of the Cls. (a) to (g) of Item 1 of Sch. IV : Lokmat Newspapers (P.) Ltd. v. Shankarprasad, A.I.R. 1999 S.C. 2423: (1999) 6 S.C.C. 275.
