Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957
(Act No. 6 of 1957)
Last Updated 15th October, 2019
Statement of Objects and Reasons - (Act No. 19 of 2000). - In the conference of State Chief Ministers and Finance Ministers held on 1-11-1999 at New Delhi, consensus has been reached to adapt uniform floor rates i.e. 4-B and 12 and two special rates i.e. 1% and 20% of sales tax by all the States with effect from 1st January, 2000. This will end the rate war amongst, the States and the Union Territories. It was also suggested that the States should bring uniform floor rates into effect through an Ordinance wherever necessary.
The Standing Committee of State Finance Ministers to monitor sales tax reforms met on 20-12-1999 at New Delhi and suggested for a deterrent action against any State not falling in line with the unanimous decision of the Committee it suggested that non-compliance with the floor rates should be treated as a negative revenue measure.
Therefore, in order to implement the rate of tax on the commodities to be in tune with the floor rates suggested by the Committee of the Chief Ministers and the Finance Ministers the Government of Andhra Pradesh have decided to amend the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957, suitably.
As the Legislative Assembly of the State was not then in Session having been prorogued and as it has been decided to give effect to the above decision immediately, the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, 1999 [A.P.
Ordinance No. 10 of 1999) has been promulgated by the Governor on the 31st December, 1999.
Further, it is also decided to amend sections 21(1)(bbb), 12, 13C, 14E and 1613) of the Act for expanding the definition of business' and for issuing separate identifiable Registration Certificates to retail dealers and to make them eligible for 'deemed assessment1 scheme irrespective of their turnovers and to levy graded penalty for the offence of non-issue of sale, bills and to levy interest for delayed payments over more than one year.
This Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance and to give effect to the above decision;
Statement of Objects and Reasons - (Act 30 of 2001). - It is noticed that certain dealers are avoiding payment of tax on actual turnovers by arranging sales through their sister concerns. Tax is being paid at the point of first sale on a very low turnover of goods and the same are sold at a higher price at the second and subsequent stages by their sister concerns and exemption is claimed on that turnover. In order to plug such leakage of revenue it is proposed to mocrfy, the definition of 'turnover'.
Similarly, certain dealers are disclosing different turnovers to different departments/ agencies to suit their convenience, if is, therefore, proposed to adopt the highest value Of the goods disclosed by the dealer to various statutory bodies or departments for the purpose of levy of tax. The fee for Registration was fixed more than a decade ago as Rs.100/-. it is now proposed to be increased to Rs. 500/-. The time limit for finalising the assessments under the Act is proposed to be reduced so that the pendency of assessments is pegged at the barest minimum. The power to seize and confiscate the unaccounted goods is presently limited to those available in office, shop, godowns etc., only in transit which arc accompanied by valid documents, it is proposed to plug the leakage of revenue by making suitable amendments are proposed for effective implementation of the provisions of the Act.
Basing on the information gathered from the market and on the requests made by the traders associations, the rate of tax or. certain commodities and the stages of levy are also sought to be modified.
To achieve the above objects and to similarly, the procedures and to plug Leakage of revenue. Government have decided to amend the Provisions of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 suitably.
This Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.
Statement of Objects and Reasons - (Act No. 3 of 2002). - It is the constant endeavour of the department to plug the loopholes so that the revenues of the state are protected. To achieve the above object, study teams were sent to neighbouring states and basing on their reports certain amendments to die provisions of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 are proposed.
As an additional revenue measure it has been decided to accept the proposal of the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, to levy Turnover Tax on the first sales of Petroleum products at 2% and on Motor Vehicles at 1% with a condition that the additional tax levied should not be passed on to the consumer as is being done in Tamil Nadu State. Accordingly an amendment to section 5-A of the APGST Act, 1957 is proposed.
In order to discourage dealers to file appeals on flimsy grounds and obtain stay of collections of taxes due. it is proposed to impose a condition of payment of certain percentage of tax before the appeals are admitted if the various appellate forums.
As the deemed assessment scheme for the deal whose turnover is less than Rs. 10.00 lakhs per annum working out smoothly, it is now proposed to extend the sale to the dealers whose turnover is less than Rs. 20 lakh also.
This amendment will speed up the assessment work substantially, and the arrear assessment work done substantially.
A decision has been taken in the made of S.I.P.B. held on 20-8-2001 to charge only (Sic) the deferred payment of sales tax as a measure of sick industry and an amendment has to be cannot to Section 16(2) (b) of the Andhra Pradesh General Tax Act, 1957.
It is also proposed to amend certain entries in the first, Third, Fourth and Sixth Schedules to the Andhra Pradesh General Sales TAx Act, 1957 to streamline the procedure and augment the revenues of the State, The entry relating to Washing machines in the sixth Schedule was modified suitably, keeping in view the judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court. In order to clear any ambiguity, imported liquor is also now proposed to be taxed at the rate of 70% along with Indian made foreign liquor. Taking into consideration the representations made by the Copra merchants the point of levy has been changed from first purchase to last purchase, Orders were already issued amending the above entries, but they are now included in the draft Bill as required under section 42 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957.
In view of the abovefacts and to protect State revenues the proposal of the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, to issue an Ordinance to levy Turnover Tax of Petrol, Diesel and Motor Vehicles etc. has been accepted and ss the Legislative Assembly of the State was not then in Session having been prorogued, the "Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax (amendment) Ordinance, 2001 (AP Ordinance No. 9 of 2001)" has been promulgated by the Governor on the 30lh November 2001 and published It on the same date.
The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.
Statement of Objects and Reasons - (Act No. 11 of 2002). - Assessments under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 have to be completed within a period of three years from the expiry of the year, to which the assessment relates.
In view of the proposed introduction of VAT with effect from 1-4-2002, a proviso was introduced, further restricting the period of limitation for finalising assessments relating to the year 1999-2000 to two years and to one year for the assessments relating to years 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. As per the national consensus, the introduction of VAT has been postponed by one year.
In order to clear the huge pendency of assessments, it is now proposed to omit the proviso, which restricted the time period so that assessments could be completed within the usual period of three years.
The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.
Statement of Objects and Reasons - (Act No. 25 of 2002). - The existing definition of dealer is suitably worded to include all bodies who make any sales or dispose of any goods.

Hence, it is proposed to amend section 2(1) of the Act.
The contractors cannot be allowed to make any interstate purchases of goods if they want to come under composition scheme. By putting such restrictions they will have to make local purchases thereby the stares revenues ore protected and our tax does not go to other states. Hence, it is proposed to insert a new sub-section under Section 5(G) of the Act, as a similar provision is available in Karnataka Sales Tax Act also.
To curb the tendency of non-issue of sales bills it is proposed to increase the quantum of penalty' in sub-section (3) (a) to Rs.5D0/- and in sub-section (3) (b) to Rs.3000/-by amending Section 13-C of the Act.
The Sales Tax dues deferred under the deferral scheme would be treated as deemed to have been paid and in the said amount is also treated as interest free Government loan. Under the Section 26-C of the Act, first charge ort the property of the dealer is not created in respect of the said loan and that in the interest of the revenue, it is desirable to include the same to avoid ambiguity and possible litigation. Hence, it is proposed to amend the Section 16-C of the Act, so that the Government dues are protected.
Orders were issued, amending column (3) against item 32 in the First Schedule to the Act relating to 'Bricks etc.' changing the point of levy- from last sale to first sale to commission of tax.
In order of levy tax on declared goods i.e. on Iron & Steel and scrap (Items 2 and 2A of III Schedule) with set off of tax at more then one stage, it is proposed to amend the entries in the Third Schedule.
