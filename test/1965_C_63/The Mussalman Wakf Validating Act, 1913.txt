The Mussalman Wakf Validating Act, 1913
(6 OF 1913)
17.
/774
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The object of this Bill is to remove disability and great hardship that has been created by the recent decisions of the Privy Council in Abdul Fata Mahomad Ishak v. Russomoy Dhur Chowdhry, LR 22 Ind App 76 and other cases. The power of a Mussalman to make a settlement for or in favour of his family, children and descedants or what is known as wakf-alal-aulad to the Mussalman Law is paralysed.
In the case above cited it was held that under Mussalman Law is perpetual family settlement expressly made as wakf is not legal and valid merely because there is an ultimate gift to the poor and it confirmed the decision in Ashanulla Chowdhry v. Amarchand Kundu, reported in LR 17 Ind App 28 the principle of which was approved in the subsequent case of Abdul Gafur v. Nizamuddin, LR 19 Ind App 170, where it was laid down that a gift is not good as wakf unless there is a substantial dedication of the property to charitable uses at some period of time or other.
The decision does not fix any limit of time, it simply says "some period of time or other". It does not define what is "substantial dedication". Thus, it introduces the greatest uncertainty in the law and is generally opposed to the true principles and correct exposition of the Mussalman Jurisprudence. This Bill is intended only to reproduce the Mussalman law or wakf-alal-aulad in a codified form which (with) certain safeguards for the authenticity of the wakfnama and for prevention of fraud upon creditors or otherwise.
It is not intended to codify or define the general law of wakf which must be governed by the Mussalman Law .................
