The Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933
(17 of 1933)
097.
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-An important source of revenue to the Indian State Broadcasting Service is the fees on licenses for wireless apparatus. These licenses are issued under the Indian Telegraph Act which, however, only gives power to control establishment, maintenance and working of such apparatus in British India. The detection of unlicensed apparatus and the successful prosecution of offenders is therefore difficult in practice as it is first necessary to locate unlicensed apparatus and then to prove that it has actually been established, maintained and worked. It is believed that the revenue lost at present owning to the use of unlicensed wireless apparatus is considerable, thus, adversely affecting the financial position of the Indian State Broadcasting Service. It is now proposed to remedy this state of affairs by legislation to prohibit the possession without license of wireless apparatus as distinct from the establishment, maintenance and working of such apparatus, and the present Bill has been drafted with this object.
Amendment Act 15 of 1961-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-With the introduction of television in India, it has become necessary to licence the possession and working of television apparatus. Although the definition of "telegraph" in the Indian Telegraph' Act, 1885 and the definition of "wireless communication" in the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933 appear to be wide enough to cover transmission and reception of visual images by television, it is considered desirable to place the matter beyond controversy by a suitable amendment of these two Acts. Opportunity has also been taken to amend section 7 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 so as to take power to prescribe by rules the qualifications for persons employed in establishing, maintaining or working wireless telegraph systems, the examinations to be passed by them and the fees to be charged for admission, to such examinations.
