The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885
(13 of 1885)
Last Updated 3rd August, 2019
Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The main object of this Bill is to give power to the Government and to any company or person licensed under section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1876, and specially empowered in this behalf, to place telegraph lines under or over property belonging whether to private persons or to public bodies.
The attention of the Government has recently been directed to the fact that as the law now stands, the Governor-General in Council and his licensees have no power to place telegraph lines upon the land of municipal or other similar bodies or of private persons. In England the requisite powers are conferred on the Postmaster-General, who works and maintains the telegraphs in that country, by 26 and 27 Vic., cap. 112, as amended by 41 and 42 Vic., cap. 76; and as it seems desirable that the Government in which the exclusive privilege of establishing telegraphs in this country is vested should possess somewhat similar powers, the present Bill has been prepared.
Section 3 empowers the Government or any company or person licensed under section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1876, and specially authorized by a Government officer to place and maintain telegraph lines and posts under, over, along, across, in or upon the property of any "person", which term includes a body corporate. It is considered that licensees should have these powers, because the licenses granted always strictly limit the area of the operations of the licensees, and it would be somewhat anomalous for local bodies and private persons to have the power to neutralize the licenses granted by the Governor-General in Council by objecting to the licensees' operations, or by hampering them by the exaction of fees for permission to work under their licenses. The powers thus given are, however, to be exercised so as to do as little damage as possible, and their exercise is moreover made subject to important restrictions and conditions.
When the property belongs to a municipal board or other local authority, the powers conferred by the Act cannot be exercised over it without the consent of that authority and that consent may be given subject to conditions. Among other conditions which can be imposed is one requiring that any expenses to which the local authority .may be put by the exercise of the power shall be made good; but it will be observed that no provision is made for the payment of compensation on any other account to a local authority whose property is made use of for this purpose, it being considered that, as the construction of telegraphs is a matter in which the public are interested, no charge should be made for accommodation of this sort when it can be granted without inconvenience to the public or expense to the local authority concerned.
It may sometimes happen that, though at the time when a telegraph authority desires to exercise its powers over some property of a local authority there may be no reasonable ground for objecting, and the local authority may thus find itself compelled to consent, a state of things may subsequently arise under which the continued exercise of the powers would be felt as a grave public inconvenience or a cause of serious loss. Land, e.g., which was waste at the time the telegraph line was constructed over it might afterwards be required for some important public object or might acquire great value for building purposes and, as no compensation (except for actual expenses out of pocket) would have been paid to the local authority at the time the line was constructed, it is but just that provisions should be made for the removal or alteration of the line in such an event. This accordingly is done by section 5 of the Bill, which empowers the local authority to call upon the telegraph authority to remove or alter its telegraph or post, and, in the event of the telegraph authority refusing or neglecting to do so gives an appeal to the Local Government.
In the event, which it is believed will be rare, of a local authority arbitrarily refusing its consent to the exercise by a telegraph authority of the powers conferred by the Bill or clogging its consent with unreasonable conditions, it will (section 7) be open to the telegraph authority to appeal to the Local Government, whose decision will be final.
Turning now to the case in which it may be desired to exercise the powers given by the Bill over the property of private persons, it will be seen that here provision is made for the payment of full compensation, the amount of which in the event of dispute will (section 9) be determined by the Civil Court, and that, in the event of a person upon whose property a telegraph line or post has been placed desiring subsequently to deal with the property in such a way as would make it necessary or convenient that the line or post should be removed to another part of it or to a higher or lower level or altered in form, he can (section 10) tender the cost of the work and call upon the telegraph authority to remove or alter the line or post and, if that authority refuses to do so, can appeal to the Civil Court.
It may be observed, however, that in practice in this country the power of taking telegraph lines through private property is not likely to be exercised either by the Government or by its licensees except on rare occasions, and then as a rule only to the extent of crossing with the wire a post being scarcely ever erected on private land. Private property has hitherto been always avoided as much as possible, and it is likely to be still more carefully avoided in future if it is made clear, as it is proposed to do by this Bill that full compensation will have to be paid for exercising the power over private and not for exercising it over public property.
The present opportunity has been taken to make three amendments of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1876, which experience has shown to be desirable. The first for its object the emendation of the definition of "telegraph" so as to bring it into more exact conformity with the construction put upon the definitions in the English Acts by a recent decision of the High Court of Justice in England.
The second is intended to provide for the regulation of telegraph lines constructed by the Government but leased to companies or individuals by whom they are worked. The position of such lines under the Act as it at present stands is far from clear, and the object of the amendment proposed in section 12 of the Bill is to put them on much the same footing as licensed lines.
The object of the third amendment which is made by section 13 of the Bill, is to prescribe penalties for the breach of the rules made under section 8 of the Act for the conduct of telegraphs worked under license or lease. In such cases, as the Act now stands the only remedy is to revoke the license or lease but this course would in most cases cause such great public inconvenience that it is impracticable. The result is that at present there is virtually no penalty for the infringement of the rules made under section 8 of the Act. To remedy this state of things, the Bill adds a clause to that section empowering the Governor-General in Council to prescribe by the rules moderate fines for the breach of them.
Select Committee Report (Extract). - We are of opinion that it would be for the convenience of the Telegraph Department and the public that Act 1 of 1876 should be repealed and re-enacted with most of the modifications and additions proposed by the Bill as introduced. We have, accordingly, re-drawn the Bill as a consolidating measure.
Amendment Act 33 of 1971-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - Under section 7(2)(a) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the rates for telegrams, whether inland or foreign, have to be prescribed by Rules. At present, the rates of inland telegrams alone are prescribed by Rules and the rates for foreign telegrams are published in the Telegraph Guide, Volume 1. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation of Rajya Sabha have pointed out that the section requires the rates at which messages shall be transmitted to be provided in the Rules themselves and not elsewhere, e.g., Posts and Telegraphs Guide and that rates cannot be kept out of purview and scrutiny of Parliament by notifying them in a document (i.e., Posts and Telegraphs Guide) which, unlike the Rules is not placed before the Parliament.
2. It is administratively impossible to prescribe the rates for transmission of foreign telegrams by rules as the rates are subject to frequent variations depending on changes in the accounting rates effected by foreign administrations. The devaluation or revaluation of Indian currency and foreign currencies also affects the structure of rates for transmission of foreign telegrams. Further, such rates have also to be revised due to changes in the rates for transmission of messages in India.
3. It is, therefore, proposed to take power to notify, from time to time, the rates for foreign telegrams keeping in view the rates for transmission of messages in force in countries outside India, foreign exchange rates for transmission of messages within India and other relevant considerations. Consequently, it is proposed to amend clause (a) of sub-section (2) of section 7 of the Act so as to prescribe rates for inland telegrams only by Rules.
4. Section 29 of the Act provides for punishment with imprisonment or fine or both of a person who transmits or causes to be transmitted by telegraph a message which he knows to be false or fabricated. It has been represented to the Government that by taking shelter under this provision, the telegraph authorities sometimes harass the press correspondents for, transmitting any news report telegraphically to their respective news agencies or newspapers found later to be false. With a view to maintaining the independence of the journalistic profession and having regard to the resolution passed by the Press Council of India in this behalf, it is proposed to omit section 29.
Amendment Act 38 of 1972-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - Section 5 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, confers powers on the Government, on the occurrence of any public contingency or in the interest of public safety, to take possession of licensed telegraphs and to order interception of messages. As doubts have been expressed about the validity of this provision, Government, after consulting the Law Commission, considers it necessary to amend sub-section (1)(b) of that section so as to limit the exercise of powers thereunder only in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, public order or friendly relations with foreign States or for preventing incitement to the commission of an offence. The object is to bring the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 5 in line with permissible heads of restrictions under article 19(2) of the Constitution. Government also considers it necessary to omit sub-section (2) of section 5 which bars judicial review of any action taken under the section. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.
Amendment Act 48 of 1974-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - Section 7 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, empowers the Central Government to make rules from time to time consistent with the Act, by notification in the Official Gazette, for the conduct of all or any telegraphs established, maintained or worked by the Government or by persons licensed under the Act. Sub-section (2) of this section enumerates the matters for which rules under this section may be made.
2. The Posts and Telegraphs Board decided in November, 1967 that applicants for new telephone connections should be required to register their demand in a standard prescribed form, machine-numbered and issued on payment of Rs. 10 non-refundable. The new forms were introduced on 1st December, 1969. This step was considered necessary for the following reasons:-
(i) to make the waiting list more realistic to enable correct planning for expansion of the telephone system;
(ii) to eliminate unnecessary bogus demands for telephone connections;
(iii) on receipt of the application for a telephone, the Department has to incur some expenditure in the registration of the application, maintaining waiting lists and for the correspondence it has to undertake with applicants regarding position of their cases up to the time the demands mature.
Taking this in view, the Posts and Telegraphs Board considered a charge of Rs. 10 as fair and reasonable to cover the abovementioned expenditure, in addition to the cost of printing and sale of the form.
3. The Committee on Subordinate Legislation of the Lok Sabha was of the view that there was no express provision in the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 conferring any power on the telegraph authority to levy charge on the application form. It was felt by the Committee that for the levy of the above charge the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, should be suitably amended.
4. It is now proposed to amend section 7 of the Act suitably with a view to empowering the Government to make rules for the levy of charges in respect of any application for providing any telegraph line, appliance or apparatus. It is also proposed to validate the charges already levied during the period commencing from 1st December, 1969 and ending with the commencement of the proposed Amendment Act.
Amendment Act 4 of 2004-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The New Telecom Policy, 1999 as approved by the Cabinet provides that resources for meeting the Universal Service Obligation will be raised through a Universal Access Levy, which will be a percentage of revenue earned by the operators under various licences. Various service providers have been issued licences under section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, on certain terms and conditions. On the basis of recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, it has been stipulated that Universal Access Levy would be a part of the licence fee. With a view to implement the New Telecom Policy, it has been decided to establish a Fund with effect from the 1st April, 2002 to be called the "Universal Service Obligation Fund" by amending the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 to meet the Universal Service Obligation. The Universal Service Obligation is the Government's commitment to provide access to basic telegraph services to people in rural or remote areas at affordable and reasonable prices. The licence fee, including the sums of money received towards the Universal Service Obligation, shall first be credited to the Consolidated Fund of India and the Central Government may, if Parliament by appropriation made by law in this behalf so provides, credit such proceeds to the Fund from time to time for being utilised exclusively for meeting the Universal Service Obligation.
Amendment Act 57 of 2006-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - Section 9-A of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 provides for the establishment of a Fund, called the "Universal Service Obligation Fund" (USO Fund) for meeting the "Universal Service Obligation". As per clause (1-A) of section 3 of the said Act, "Universal Service Obligation" means the obligation to provide access to basic telegraph services to people in the rural and remote areas at affordable and reasonable prices. At present, support from USO Fund is being provided only for the basic telegraph services, that is, wire-line and fixed wireless terminals.
2. The National Telecom Policy, 1999 has set the target of achieving rural tele-density from the level of 0.4 in 2002 to 4.0 by the year 2010. The rural tele-density has increased to 1.77 by the year 2005. In order to facilitate telecom penetration in the rural areas, it is considered desirable to support new wireless technologies which can be rolled out much faster. Therefore, cellular mobile service is to be deployed for rapid expansion of telegraph services in rural and remote areas at affordable and reasonable prices. Accordingly, the financial support from USO Fund is required to be provided for cellular services in such areas.
3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.
