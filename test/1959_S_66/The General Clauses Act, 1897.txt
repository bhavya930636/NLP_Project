The General Clauses Act, 1897
(10 of 1897 )
033.
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-This Bill does not propose to effect any change in the law. Its object, like that of the Acts it consolidates, is to shorten the language of the statutory enactments and to provide for uniformity of expression in cases where there is identity of subject-matter.
The first enactment of the kind was Lord Brougham's Act (13 and 14 Vict., c. 21). The provisions of that statute were adopted to India, and somewhat amplified, by General Clauses Act (1 of 1868), and the General Clauses Act (1 of 1887) was a further extension of the same principle. It is obviously expedient that the legislative dictionary, as it may be called, should be contained in a single enactment, and that the two Acts above referred to should be consolidated, and it seems desirable to take the opportunity of making any additions that later experience may have suggested, and in particular to incorporate such provisions of the Interpretation Act, 1889 (52 and 53 Vict., c. 63), as are applicable to India. That Statute, like the Indian Act of 1887, was drafted by Sir C. Ilbert, and is in effect a careful revision and extension of the latter. For example, the definition of "British India" in the English Act of 1889 is merely an expansion of the definition given by the Indian Act of 1868. Its legal effect is the same, but it is more intelligible, and it avoids a reference to another Statute. Now this definition is substituted by A.O. The proposed measure will have this further advantage that it will tend to secure uniformity of language and construction in Indian and English legislation, in so far as both have to deal with the same subject-matter.
[11th March, 1897]
An Act to consolidate and extend the General Clauses Acts, 1868 and 1887.
Whereas it is expedient to consolidate and extend the General Clauses Acts, 1868 (1 of 1868) and 1887 (1 of 1887);
It is hereby enacted as follows:
This Act has been declared to be in force in the Sonthal Parganas by the Sonthal Pargans Settlement Regulation, 1872, and in the Angul District by the Angul Laws Regulation, 1936.
It has been partially extended to Berar by the Berar by the Berar Laws Act, 1941 and amended in Assam by the Assam Commissioner's Powers Distribution Act, 1939.
It has also been extended to the new Provinces and Merged States by the Merged States (Laws) Act 59 of 1949 and to the States of Manipur, Tripura and Vindhya Pradesh by the Union Territories (Laws) Act 30 of 1950-. Manipur and Tripura are full-fledged States now, see Act 81 of 1971, Vindhya Pradesh is a part of the State of Madhya Pradesh now, see Act 37 of 1956.
This Act has not been extended to the Union territory of-
(1) Goa, Daman and Diu by Regn.12 of 1962.Goa is now a State, see 18 of 1987, Section 3 (w.e.f. 30-5-1987);
